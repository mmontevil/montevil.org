> The juxtaposition of The HTTP Archive’s analysis and The State of JS 2020 Survey results suggest that <mark>a disproportionately small—yet exceedingly vocal minority—of white male developers advocate strongly for React</mark>, and by extension, a development experience that favors thick client/thin server architectures which are given to poor performance in adverse conditions. Such conditions are less likely to be experienced by white male developers themselves, therefore reaffirming and reflecting their own biases in their work.
