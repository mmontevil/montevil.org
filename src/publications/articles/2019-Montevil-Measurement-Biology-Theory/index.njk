  <p class="indent">
    We characterize access to empirical objects in biology from a theoretical perspective. Unlike objects in current physical theories, biological objects are the result of a history and their variations continue to generate a history. This property is the starting point of our concept of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is relative to a natural history which is shared by the different objects subjected to the measurement and is more or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to considering biological objects as equivalent in a measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by studying objects as similar as possible, while others build on biological diversity.

<h2 class="sectionHead" id="1----introduction"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-30001">1 </span> Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  Science and more specifically biology and medicine are facing a crisis where
  systematic attempts to reproduce experiments published in reputable journals fail in
  the majority of cases (<a href="#Xreprodcancer2012">Begley &amp; Ellis</a>, <a href="#Xreprodcancer2012">2012</a>; <a href="#X2016Nature533ee452B">Baker</a>, <a href="#X2016Nature533ee452B">2016</a>). The management and
  organization of scientific institutions have been investigated, and the pressure to
  publish has been heavily criticized (<a href="#XBegley116">Begley &amp; Ioannidis</a>, <a href="#XBegley116">2014</a>; <a href="#XLancet2018">Lancet</a>, <a href="#XLancet2018">2018</a>). In the
  case of experimental biology, theoretical and philosophical analyses can also play a
  role to understand and respond to this crisis (<a href="#Xnadin2017rethinking">Nadin</a>, <a href="#Xnadin2017rethinking">2017</a>). There are aspects proper
  to biological experiments that should be analyzed systematically in light of the
  current understanding of living beings. This discussion is also particularly relevant
  now that the scientific focus on (Big) Data analyses bears the risk of forgetting that
  data are generated in specific empirical conditions (<a href="#Xdoi10e11772053951714534395">Leonelli</a>, <a href="#Xdoi10e11772053951714534395">2014</a>). Data detached
  from these conditions without proper justification do not carry a genuine scientific
  meaning.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A scientist cannot assume that her access to reality is one of an omniscient
  daemon. Understanding what it means to observe natural phenomena is fundamental.
  This question is multi-faceted. Part of it pertains to the complementary knowledge
  advocated by <a href="#Xchang2004inventing">Chang</a> (<a href="#Xchang2004inventing">2004</a>), but part of the answer should be principled, in the
  relevant theoretical framework. We concur with Einstein’s epistemological
  statement: “whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory
  which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed” (A.
  Einstein quoted in  <a href="#XSalam_1990_Unification_of_Fundamental_Forces">Salam</a>, <a href="#XSalam_1990_Unification_of_Fundamental_Forces">1990</a>). In physics, measurement is described
  in theories and is a fundamental part of their formulation. The notion of
  measurement embedded in theories provides a general link between the output
  of measurement and the theoretical and mathematical description of the
  objects of study. For example, measurements in classical mechanics provide
  approximate results while they change objects in quantum mechanics. There are
  many other aspects of measurement which are philosophically important;
  however, in this article, we aim to ground widely shared practices on theoretical
  principles.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Biologists often use physical concepts, and measurement is no exception. The
  notion of measurement of classical mechanics is widely used in biology. Moreover,
  <a href="#Xdoi10e1111je15585646e2009e00909ex">Wagner</a> (<a href="#Xdoi10e1111je15585646e2009e00909ex">2010</a>) and <a href="#Xhoule2011measurement">Houle et al.</a> (<a href="#Xhoule2011measurement">2011</a>) advocate the use of measurement theory in
  biology. This setting leads us to inquire whether biology requires a distinct
  notion of measurement. In the literature, there is at least one such account:
  following the informational metaphor, molecular biology often considers
  measurement as a classical measurement applied to <span class="cmti-10">finite, entirely discrete</span>
  features: the sequences of nucleotides. A classical measurement has a limited
  precision, but knowing finite, discrete structures with a sufficient <span class="cmti-10">finite </span>precision
  means knowing them <span class="cmti-10">exactly </span>(<a href="#Xschrodinger">Schrödinger</a>, <a href="#Xschrodinger">1944</a>). The same reasoning
  applies <span class="cmti-10">mutadis mutandis </span>to other discrete structures such as the topology of
  networks (<a href="#XHuneman2018">Huneman</a>, <a href="#XHuneman2018">2018</a>). This reasoning only applies to the discrete aspect
  of the objects, and not the continuous ones such as position in physical
  space.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  This point of view is in contrast with experimental methodologies which are very
  rich and sometimes subtle (<a href="#Xweber2004philosophy">Weber</a>, <a href="#Xweber2004philosophy">2004</a>; <a href="#Xkohler1994lords">Kohler</a>, <a href="#Xkohler1994lords">1994</a>). In this paper, we argue
  that general <span class="cmti-10">theoretical principles </span>of biology leads to a theoretical account
  of biological measurement which clarifies several aspects of experimental
  methodologies.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Measurement requires commensurability. For example, measuring the length of an
  object requires to identify the distance between its edges with the length of
  another object such as a ruler. It also requires abstract constructs: in this
  example not only a theory of space (or space-time) but also assumptions on
  the object measured. These assumptions ensure that the measurement has
  a meaning (<a href="#Xhoule2011measurement">Houle et al.</a>, <a href="#Xhoule2011measurement">2011</a>). For example, when measuring a length,
  is the object solid, or flexible, does it have well-defined boundaries, like a
  box, or not, like a cloud. As a result, measurement is never only about a
  single object (token). In biology, the measurement of a part or an aspect of
  an organism may be performed by the commensurability with a physical
  object, for example, the length (in meters) of this organism, here and now,
  measured in physical units. However, this alone is only sufficient to know if we
  can put it ”as is” in a box of a given length. The biological meaning of a
  length and the procedure to assess it are very different for a tree or a snake.
  Therefore, we posit that biological measurement is not only about the intended
  part or aspect, but also has to accommodate the organism measured and its
  commensurability with other organisms. We will develop mostly the latter idea
  since it has not been systematically analyzed and raises questions which are
  proper to biology. To address the specificities of biological measurement and
  conceptualize the commensurability of organisms, we need theoretical insights on
  organisms.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  We use the principles proposed recently for a theory of organisms (<a href="#Xchapterorganization">Mossio
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchapterorganization">2016</a>; <a href="#Xchaptervariation">Montévil et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchaptervariation">2016</a>; <a href="#Xchapterdefault">Soto et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchapterdefault">2016a</a>). This framework provides a
  conceptual continuity between the understanding of organisms and evolution.
  In particular, it emphasizes historical analyses both for phylogenesis and
  ontogenesis.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In this framework, biological objects are not defined theoretically like objects in
  physical theories. The theoretical definition of objects is mathematical in physics.
  Despite quantitative differences, the changes of a well-defined object are assumed
  to follow an underlying mathematical structure. Invariants and invariant
  preserving transformations (symmetries) define these mathematical structures
  (<a href="#Xvan1989laws">Van Fraassen</a>, <a href="#Xvan1989laws">1989</a>; <a href="#Xlongomont">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongomont">2014</a>). For example, a falling stone
  follows the same equation during its fall despite its changes of position and velocity,
  and a falling log would follow the same equation. As a result, physicists can
  talk about the generic phenomenon of falling bodies. Physical notions of
  measurement apply to generic objects, and the reproducibility of physical
  experiments is guaranteed, at least statistically, once the same generic conditions
  apply.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  By contrast, biological objects are historical in the sense that their organizations
  stem from an evolutionary and individual history and continue to produce a
  history. This idea has been developed theoretically and called the principle of
  variation (<a href="#Xchaptervariation">Montévil et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchaptervariation">2016</a>). To an extent, this principle is in line with
  earlier ideas, in particular, the contingency thesis of <a href="#XBeattycontingency">Beatty</a> (<a href="#XBeattycontingency">1995</a>) and the
  centrality of historicity defended by <a href="#Xgould2002structure">Gould</a> (<a href="#Xgould2002structure">2002</a>, chap. 11) in a critical
  assessment of the work of D’Arcy Thomson. For example, a falling tetrapod is not
  a purely physical notion since “tetrapod” is a biological concept. In the
  atmosphere, tetrapods do not just fall, some fly and others are gliders. All
  these behaviors require different equations, and these changes of equation
  depend on the underlying evolutionary history. This basic example illustrates
  the general idea that biological objects should not be conceived as generic
  and are prone to more profound changes than objects in physics, including
  the appearance of new possibilities (<a href="#Xnovelty2017">Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xnovelty2017">2018</a>). Moreover, biological
  objects are contextual in the sense that their organizations depend on their
  past and current contexts. In other words, describing biological objects does
  not just involve many quantities, but quantities which are endowed with
  different biological meaning, and new relevant quantities can appear over
  time.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In a nutshell, biologists manipulate objects which are understood theoretically as
  the result of a history and continue to produce a history: diachronic objects. With
  these ideas stemming from the theory of evolution in mind, experimental
  reproducibility is not a straightforward notion. Biological objects tend spontaneously
  to vary whereas perfect reproducibility, even statistically, would require fixed
  physiology and development, at least at an abstract level.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In section <a href="#x1-40002">2</a>, we introduce how several physical theories define measurement and
  the epistemological and theoretical roles this notion plays. Section <a href="#x1-90003">3</a> discusses the
  theoretical nature of biological measurement. Biological measurements accommodate
  natural histories and contexts, not just quantities. Section <a href="#x1-190004">4</a> explores several
  implications of our framework. In particular, we classify different research strategies
  to handle biological measurement.

<h2 class="sectionHead" id="2----measurement-in-physics"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-40002">2 </span> Measurement in physics</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  In order to exemplify our aims in biology, we discuss briefly how the main physical
  theories conceptualize measurement. We are interested in measurement considered <span class="cmti-10">in</span>
  <span class="cmti-10">principle </span>in general theoretical frameworks and not in specific experimental
  situations. For the theory, what does “obtaining quantities” in experiments or
  observations means? These accounts are sufficiently general to be valid for <span class="cmti-10">any</span>
  practical situation in the corresponding theory, and they have deep practical and
  theoretical consequences.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="21----classical-measurement"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-50002e1">2.1 </span> Classical measurement</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  In classical mechanics, a system has a pointwise state in the space of possible states.
  The empirical access to this state is approximate: a measurement has a finite
  precision, <span class="cmmi-10">ϵ</span>, which can <span class="cmti-10">in principle </span>be arbitrarily small. Thus, the state
  of a system is a point, and the result of the measurement is an interval.
  Classical measurement is a <span class="cmti-10">metrical </span>notion: it stems from the concept of
  distance.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Classical dynamics are deterministic, but measurements may or may not
  allow to predict the subsequent trajectory. Unpredictable dynamics such as
  chaotic dynamics are called sensitive to initial conditions. The notion of
  measurement articulates determinism and randomness in the sense of theoretical
  impredictability (<a href="#Xgillies2012philosophical">Gillies</a>, <a href="#Xgillies2012philosophical">2012</a>; <a href="#Xlongo2014">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongo2014">2017</a>). This example
  shows that a simple notion of measurement can have far-reaching conceptual
  consequences.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="22----quantum-measurement"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-60002e2">2.2 </span> Quantum measurement</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  In quantum mechanics, measurement involves the commensurability of a microscopic
  object and a macroscopic object. Quantum measurement changes the object and
  leads to quantum randomness. Informally, a quantum state can be decomposed <span class="cmti-10">for a</span>
  <span class="cmti-10">given measurement </span>as the superposition (the sum) of different states called
  eigenstates. Each of them corresponds to a single obtainable result. Performing the
  measurement means that the state of the system becomes an eigenstate associated
  with the quantity obtained. The other eigenstates in the initial superposition
  disappear irreversibly. Quantum measurement has an <span class="cmti-10">algebraic </span>(and geometric)
  nature.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  There is an internal coherence to this notion. Performing the same measurement
  twice in a row will lead to the same result because the state of the object is already
  an eigenstate associated with this result: the result obtained in the first measurement
  is the only possible outcome in the second.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Different observables do not necessarily lead to the same decomposition. An
  eigenstate which corresponds to a specific position, for example, does not
  correspond to a specific velocity and the other way around. Then, measuring the
  position, measuring the velocity and measuring the position again will not
  necessarily lead to the same position twice. Lastly, some authors argue that, in an
  experiment, a measurement is needed to put the system in a known initial state
  (<a href="#Xmmm">Mugur-Schächter</a>, <a href="#Xmmm">2002</a>). The typical theoretical structure of an experiment
  is then: measurement, time evolution (Schrödinger equation typically),
  measurement.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="23----reference-frame"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-70002e3">2.3 </span> Reference frame</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Experimenters choose space-time reference frames arbitrarily to represent concrete
  situations and describe features such as positions quantitatively. Relativity (Galilean,
  special and general) states how the description of a situation in one reference frame
  can be transformed into the description of the same situation in another reference
  frame and ensures that these descriptions are coherent. This concept overcomes
  the arbitrary choices of reference frames, and its mathematical nature is
  geometric.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="24----conclusion"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-80002e4">2.4 </span> Conclusion</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  The concepts of physical measurement we described are principles in their respective
  theory, and they are very different. Their common point is that they all describe the
  role of the experimenter and its instruments in an abstract and very concise
  way.

and invariant preserving transformations (symmetries) which would provide
a generic meaning to the features observed. Instead, their regularities are
constraints that come from an history and collectively maintain each other in a
given context. These constraints can change over time as the objects continue
to generate a history over physiologic, developmental and evolutive time scales.
An account of biological measurement has to accommodate simultaneously the
measured aspects (constraints) and the rest of the organism which we describe
as a specific object.</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<hr class="endfloat" />
<p class="noindent">
  To describe our theoretical notion of biological measurement, we rely mainly on the
  principle of variation (<a href="#Xchaptervariation">Montévil et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchaptervariation">2016</a>). This principle builds on evolutionary
  biology and states that biological objects can vary in a stronger sense than objects
  described by physical theories. The latter change, but physicists understand their
  changes by underlying stable mathematical structures. Instead, biological variations
  in the strong sense require changing mathematical structures. Biological objects are
  formed by a cascade of such variations and the notions of historicity and
  contextuality become fundamental. Figure <a href="#x1-90011">1</a> summarizes this perspective which
  guides our analysis of biological measurement.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In physics, objects can be highly simplified and remain relevant for physics. For
  example, it is sound to study a material composed only of iron. In biology, this is not
  the case. For example, looking at one or several molecules alone pertains to
  biochemistry, not biology. In biology, the measured features of organisms or cells,
  such as the concentration of molecules or the shape of tissues, are measured <span class="cmti-10">in</span>
  organisms or cells and are generally produced and maintained by them (<a href="#Xchapterorganization">Mossio
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchapterorganization">2016</a>; <a href="#XMontevil2015c">Montévil &amp; Mossio</a>, <a href="#XMontevil2015c">2015</a>). Therefore, our discussion of biological
  measurement is not limited to the parts observed <span class="cmti-10">per se</span>. Instead, our approach of
  measurement accommodates both the parts observed and the organisms associated.
  Both are reported carefully in empirical studies, and we posit that they are
  elementary aspects of biological measurement. This section may be seen as the
  theorization of a typical “method section” in any experimental paper in
  biology.

<hr class="endfloat" />
<p class="noindent">
  Reporting a biological measurement starts with describing the organisms observed
  and naming them. The theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of these names
  are an essential aspect of biological measurements. The standard, general way to
  name organisms is to use systematics. Biologists always use this method,
  even though other methods can complement it, as discussed in the following
  section.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  We want to emphasize two aspects of this method that impact the concept of
  measurement. The first is the definition of the names themselves and the second is
  the phylogenetic classification of living beings (<a href="#XdeQueiroz1992">de Queiroz</a>, <a href="#XdeQueiroz1992">1992</a>; <a href="#Xlecointre2006tree">Lecointre &amp;
Le Guyader</a>, <a href="#Xlecointre2006tree">2006</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In order to provide stability to the meaning of the names used to describe living
  beings, systematics establish and follow strict rules to describe new species and other
  clades (e.g., genus, family). Nomenclature codes use the principle of typification.
  Typification means that defining a name requires a type. For example, the definition
  of a name at the family level requires a genus-level type, a genus-level name requires
  a species type, and describing a new species (or subspecies) requires referring to one
  specimen (holotype) or several specimens (syntype) which are kept in a
  collection (<a href="#Xride1999international">CZN International</a>, <a href="#Xride1999international">1999</a>; <a href="#Xmcneill2012international">McNeill et al.</a>, <a href="#Xmcneill2012international">2012</a>, art. 72.3 and 40
  resp.). Typification ensures the stability of the definition of names even if the
  classification changes. Name-bearing types are required to be in a biologically
  inactive state and thus are fixed reference objects (<a href="#Xmcneill2012international">McNeill et al.</a>, <a href="#Xmcneill2012international">2012</a>, art.
  8.4).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Typification implies that the definition of biological names ultimately depends on
  specific, static, material objects (<a href="#Xgrandcolas2017loosing">Grandcolas</a>, <a href="#Xgrandcolas2017loosing">2017</a>). This situation is in contrast
  with the theoretical definitions in the International System of Unit based on physical
  theories. For example, a meter is the distance traveled by light in vacuum in
  1<span class="cmmi-10">∕</span>299792458 seconds. This definition refers to matter but does not need the
  conservation of a specific object. Instead, it uses the generic, theoretical object called
  “light in the vacuum” which has an invariant velocity in both special and general
  relativity<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">[1]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Names associated with specific material objects (types) are not sufficient for
  scientific practices. In order to endow names with a more general meaning,
  systematics uses the phylogenetic classification method (<a href="#XdeQueiroz1992">de Queiroz</a>, <a href="#XdeQueiroz1992">1992</a>; <a href="#Xlecointre2006tree">Lecointre
&amp; Le Guyader</a>, <a href="#Xlecointre2006tree">2006</a>). This method classifies living beings by estimating their
  genealogy. The genealogy is a theoretical concept that stems from the theory of
  evolution; however, the genealogy of current organisms spans billions of years, and
  human observers cannot access it directly. As a result, the phylogenetic classification
  uses different concepts than a genealogical tree. For example, it is impossible to
  determine whether a fossil species is an ancestor of a current species, but it is
  possible to establish that they are closely related genealogically. The phylogenetic
  method distinguishes a theoretical level and an observable level which is
  reminiscent of the distinction between a state and what can be observed in
  physics.

  The phylogenetic classification assesses the evolutionary proximity between
  different organisms. Systematists start with the characters characterizing the
  different organisms, including <span class="cmcsc-10"><span class="small-caps">dna</span> </span>sequences. These characters are used by a
  computational method which provides a nested hierarchy of groups, see figure <a href="#x1-100012">2</a>.
  These methods typically assume that the most likely situation minimizes the number
  of evolutionary changes, and in particular the appearance of novelties. These analyses
  lead to classifications where acceptable groups, called monophyletic groups or clades,
  are the descent of a common theoretical ancestor. The classification can then be used
  for taxonomic purposes. Of course, evolutionary reasonings guide the choice of the
  characters and the computational method used, and these choices are commonly
  debated.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Clades are defined by their estimated historical origin and not by their current
  ecological status or physiology. Since the definition of clades is based on a historical
  analysis, it accommodates the diversity and diversification of living beings
  straightforwardly. For example, the famous goat (<span class="cmti-10">Capra aegagrus hircus</span>) discussed by
  <a href="#Xwest2003developmental">West-Eberhard</a> (<a href="#Xwest2003developmental">2003</a>) is a paradigmatic example of developmental plasticity because
  it is bipedal: a significant change occurred in a single specimen. Despite
  its peculiarities, this specimen is still part of the subspecies <span class="cmti-10">C. aegagrus</span>
  <span class="cmti-10">hircus </span>because the subspecies is defined by its historical origin, not by its
  properties.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Biological observations typically refer to a specific clade, usually a species or
  subspecies. By definition of a clade, this only ascertains a given shared theoretical
  ancestor. This common past involves similarities between the specimens studied, but
  it does not guarantee that the properties of interest in a given investigation will be
  similar or even exist.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="32----observed-and-controlled-genealogy"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-110003e2">3.2 </span> Observed and controlled genealogy</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  The design and description of typical biological experiments use genealogical
  elements that go beyond what systematics can provide. Genealogical knowledge is
  provided by the direct observation of the lineages leading to the specimens studied
  and can be more or less comprehensive. Of course, direct genealogical knowledge is
  limited to the historical period where biologists follow the appropriate methods, that
  is to say, about a century at best.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Usually, direct genealogical knowledge goes with more or less control over the
  genealogy. In the case of organisms reproducing sexually, there are two main
  strategies to control genealogies: establishing inbred or outbred strains, see figure <a href="#x1-110013">3</a>A.
  Inbred strains stem from several generations of inbreeding. By enforcing this
  behavior, biologists aim to obtain a genetically homogeneous population. Inbred
  strains still change over time at least as a consequence of genetic drift. These changes
  lead to the definition of substrains that have biologically relevant differences and are
  not interchangeable (<a href="#Xsimpson1997genetic">Simpson et al.</a>, <a href="#Xsimpson1997genetic">1997</a>). By contrast, outbred strains aim to
  maintain heterozygote populations while keeping as much genetic homogeneity as
  possible. These strains are more genetically labile than inbred strains and are often
  considered more variable phenotypically (<a href="#Xchia2005origins">Chia et al.</a> <a href="#Xchia2005origins">2005</a>; <a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilu036">Festing</a> <a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilu036">2014</a>, however
  see <a href="#Xjensen2016rodent">Jensen et al.</a> <a href="#Xjensen2016rodent">2016</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A specific nomenclature for strains completes the nomenclature deriving from
  systematics. For example, a widespread strain in biomedical research is the inbred
  mouse strain C57BL/6 (Black 6) (<a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilu036">Festing</a>, <a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilu036">2014</a>). Naming strains to report an
  experiment includes the breeding institution. For example, C57BL/6NCrl are Black 6
  mice from the National Institutes of Health (N) and which are bred by Charles River
  Laboratory (Crl) (<a href="#Xblack6">Sacca et al.</a>, <a href="#Xblack6">2013</a>).

genetic manipulations, selection in outbred strains, or just as the result of
genetic drift. B: <span class="cmti-10">Controlled genealogies in the case of cells. </span>Doing a standard
subculture is not enough to ensure that the individuals of a population share
a recent common ancestor. To ensure a recent common ancestor, biologists
typically perform a highly diluted subculture which isolates a single cell.
This cell and its descent proliferate, and their proliferation leads to a new
population. This population can then be frozen in order to stop biological
processes, and in particular to stop proliferation and the associated variations
(<a href="#Xchapterdefault">Soto et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchapterdefault">2016a</a>). Subsets of this frozen population can be used to perform
experiments and be shared with other laboratories. The cells obtained using this
method share a known, recent common ancestor and are often used to reproduce
experiments.</span></figcaption>

</div>
<hr class="endfloat" />
<p class="indent">
  The choice of strain can profoundly impact experimental results. For example,
  Black 6 mice have singular features such as their nociception (sensation of pain)
  (<a href="#XMOGIL199967">Mogil et al.</a>, <a href="#XMOGIL199967">1999</a>). <a href="#XIsaacs3958">Isaacs</a> (<a href="#XIsaacs3958">1986</a>) tested the incidence of tumors in rats exposed to
  the carcinogen DMBA and found that this incidence is 0%, 15%, 40% and above 90%
  depending on the strain used. The sensitivity to endocrine disruptors also depends on
  the strain (<a href="#Xspearow1999genetic">Spearow et al.</a>, <a href="#Xspearow1999genetic">1999</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case of cells, the situation is overall similar to the case of animals. Cell lines
  and sub-lines are established, named, and exchanged between laboratories. For
  example, the first laboratory immortal human cell line, the HeLa cell line, originated
  from a single patient, Henrietta Lacks (who died in 1951) and thus HeLa cells have a
  common origin. This cell line is widely used, and more than 99000 references in
  PubMed mention it (08/2018). Cell lines have two specificities (fig. <a href="#x1-110013">3</a>B). First, a
  single cell can originate a clonal population in common cases. Second, the use of
  frozen samples enables biologist to “stop” biological time. Biologists use these
  operations to obtain populations of cells that are far closer genealogically to their
  common ancestor than cells which would be proliferating with variations in
  culture.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Both animal strains and cell lines can be modified for research purposes, either by
  artificial selection for a specific trait or by genetic engineering, a subject extensively
  discussed by <a href="#Xkohler1994lords">Kohler</a> (<a href="#Xkohler1994lords">1994</a>) in the case of <span class="cmti-10">Drosophila melanogaster</span>. These
  modifications are not only aiming for a specific new trait; they include ruling out
  animals with spontaneous, problematic mutations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  It is standard practice to communicate live sample between research laboratories
  or between breeding institutions (<a href="#Xkohler1994lords">Kohler</a>, <a href="#Xkohler1994lords">1994</a>, chap. 5). Communicating live
  samples is required for biologists to ensure that the specimens studied in
  different laboratories are close genealogically and carry the same spontaneous or
  artificial changes if any. Commitment to perform these exchanges is required to
  publish in many journals. Replicating an experiment using specimens from a
  controlled genealogy requires an exchange of matter, a point that we discuss in
  section <a href="#x1-200004e1">4.1</a>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Genealogies are not limited to cell division and sexual reproduction. Viruses lead
  to horizontal transfers, biologists use a diversity of manipulations, such as chimera
  obtained by the fusion of different zygotes. Last, some authors consider that
  microbiomes should be considered as parts of organisms which implies that several
  lineages come together to form a holobiont (<a href="#Xholobiont">Gilbert</a>, <a href="#Xholobiont">2014</a>). These examples are
  beyond the basic concept of genealogy but fit a broader concept of genealogy <span class="cmti-10">sensu</span>
  the historical origins of specimens.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The use of controlled strains and cells lines is not universal in biological
  experiments. For example, cells may come directly from recent human samples, and
  animals may come from captures in the wild. However, the practice of using
  sometimes very tightly controlled genealogies is widespread, in particular in
  biomedical research. The active control of genealogies, including modifications, leads
  to a situation where the natural history of the specimens is entangled with the
  human history of biological sciences (see <a href="#Xkohler1994lords">Kohler</a>, <a href="#Xkohler1994lords">1994</a>, for a discussion in the case of
  <span class="cmti-10">D. melanogaster</span>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The knowledge and control over part of the recent genealogy of the specimens
  experimented upon is a supplement to the phylogenetic method of classification. It
  ensures that the specimen studied have a recent shared past. Even though this
  control is tighter than with the classifications of systematics alone, the same
  theoretical and philosophical limitations apply: the description is historical and does
  not ensure that the specimens have the very same organizations. Nevertheless, several
  methods provide partial control over biological organizations. For example, inbred
  strains are (almost) homogeneous genetically, and some aspects of animal phenotypes
  are controlled regularly in breeding institutions. Thus, these methods provide precise
  knowledge and control over the historical origin of the specimens studied and limited
  direct control over their organizations.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="33----historical-contexts"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-120003e3">3.3 </span> Historical contexts</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Knowledge and control of the past of organisms and cells used in an experiment are
  not limited to their genealogy. Their past contexts are also relevant. By context, we
  mean the environment, including the possible interactions with other organisms. The
  control of past contexts can go from the timescale of many generations to
  the timescale of ontogenesis or even the shorter time scales preceding the
  experiment.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case of cell culture, the control and knowledge of the context stem first
  from the use of a standardized medium, temperature, and protection from
  contaminations. Even the choice of supplies such as centrifugal tubes used with
  the medium can have dramatic consequences on cellular behaviors (<a href="#X10e23073431154">Soto
et al.</a>, <a href="#X10e23073431154">1991</a>). Another critical parameter is the density of cells. When this
  density is too low, the lack of quorum effect can change cellular behaviors. On
  the opposite, when the density is too high, the cells constrain each other’s
  proliferation. Moreover, cells typically need time to adjust to a change of conditions
  such as a change of medium <a href="#Xlongo2011">Longo &amp; Montévil</a> (<a href="#Xlongo2011">2011b</a>). All these factors
  are important since they determine the status of the cells subjected to the
  experimentation. In order to perform controlled experiments, experimenters
  choose an initial status that can be obtained consistently in a cell population
  (homogeneity) and different replicates (reproducibility). The most straightforward
  condition that can be obtained and sustained consistently is unconstrained
  proliferation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case of animals, the situation is similar to that of cells. In laboratory
  conditions, the control of the context includes typically the temperature, light cycle,
  the nature and quantity of food, avoiding pathogens, and the number of animals per
  cage. For example, <a href="#XHEINDEL201533">Heindel et al.</a> (<a href="#XHEINDEL201533">2015</a>, section 2.6) describe the context in which
  animals are raised before and during a large scale experiment. However, their
  past context can be considered problematic. This work aims to study the
  effects of the endocrine-disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA). The animal
  experimented upon are raised in BPA free cages, but they originate from
  strains which are raised in polycarbonate cages by the animal provider, and
  polycarbonate leaks BPA. The exposure of pregnant females to BPA have
  known effects spanning two generations (“grandmother effect”, <a href="#Xsusiarjo2007bisphenol">Susiarjo
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xsusiarjo2007bisphenol">2007</a>) and there are other known and probably also unknown epigenetic
  factors.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Understanding the importance of past contexts requires a short theoretical
  discussion on heredity. Under the assumption that <span class="cmcsc-10"><span class="small-caps">dna</span> </span>sequences are the only
  form of heredity, contexts before an experiment are relevant only during
  development. However, this assumption is not valid in general, and epigenetic
  inheritance is a widespread phenomenon (<a href="#Xjablonka2009transgenerational">Jablonka &amp; Raz</a>, <a href="#Xjablonka2009transgenerational">2009</a>; <a href="#Xjablonka2014evolution">Jablonka
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xjablonka2014evolution">2014</a>; <a href="#Xdanchpoch">Danchin et al.</a>, <a href="#Xdanchpoch">In press</a>). Let us introduce a simple example that does
  not require recent advances in epigenetics. MMTV is a retrovirus which can be
  inherited exogenously from the milk of an infected host to another animal,
  usually its descent (<a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilv044">Dudley et al.</a>, <a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilv044">2016</a>). If, say, inbred mice are fed milk from
  contaminated mice of another strain, then these mice will carry MMTV and
  transmit it to their descent. A contaminated female will lead to a substrain
  which is genetically identical to the original inbred strain (as long as the
  retrovirus does not alter mice DNA) but has critical immunological and oncologic
  differences.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Many strategies such as working with inbred strains or clonal cell populations
  strive for genetic uniformity. These strategies could be extended formally to
  known forms of epigenetic heredity. However, the knowledge and control of
  past contexts over several generations is an <span class="cmti-10">indirect</span>, partial way to control
  known and unknown epigenetic heredity, in combination with the control
  of genealogies. As a conclusion, past contexts over several generations are
  relevant.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The context at the timescale of one generation is also relevant, as advocated by
  the concept of ecological developmental biology (<a href="#Xgilbert2009ecological">Gilbert &amp; Epel</a>, <a href="#Xgilbert2009ecological">2009</a>). Even the
  position of a fetus relative to its male and female siblings in the uterus has a
  measurable impact (<a href="#XRyan2002665">Ryan &amp; Vandenbergh</a>, <a href="#XRyan2002665">2002</a>). The context matters at shorter
  timescales too. For example, to measure heart rate or blood pressure on a rat,
  biologists need to take into account the memory and anticipation associated with the
  procedure (<a href="#Xlongo2011">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongo2011">2011b</a>; <a href="#Xnadin2017rethinking">Nadin</a>, <a href="#Xnadin2017rethinking">2017</a>, for conceptual frameworks). In
  this particular case, the stress induced by the measurement impacts the heart rate
  and can be limited by training the animal, that is changing its anticipations (<a href="#Xgross2003exercising">Gross &amp;
Luft</a>, <a href="#Xgross2003exercising">2003</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The context in which organisms and cells live before the experiment matters from
  the timescale of several generations to the timescales of development and physiology.
  The work on past contexts complements the one on genealogies as a method to
  manage the past of the specimens studied. It follows that the same epistemological
  limitations apply.

</div>
<hr class="endfloat" />
<p class="noindent">
  Overall, the discussion in the previous section applies also to the context during an
  experiment. The context contributes to the definition of the specimens and
  quantities observed. This contribution is both practical and theoretical. It is
  practical because it describes the necessary operations required to perform
  the same measurement beyond using the same apparatus and reading its
  results. It is theoretical because the meaning of the results depends on these
  operations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  To illustrate the importance of the context, let us consider the example
  of mammal metabolism observed by the oxygen consumption rate. This
  rate seems to be a simple empirical quantity; however, it depends on the
  activity of the organism observed and its relevant components. To compare the
  metabolism of different organisms, biologists define different kinds of physiological
  activity. The target activities have to be meaningful and achievable for all the
  organisms considered, which may be difficult when measurement applies to
  the many different species of a large clade. In all cases, the meaning of the
  results depends on the nature of the activity chosen (fig. <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>). Metabolic rates
  have several definitions (<a href="#Xlongomont">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongomont">2014</a>, chap. 2 for a review):
</p>
<ul class="itemize1">
  <li class="itemize">
    The field metabolic rate (FMR) corresponds to the activity of organisms
    in an ecosystem, without constraints from the observer (fig. <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E1).
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">
    The basal metabolic rate (BMR) considers organisms at rest, that is to say,
    undisturbed, non-sleeping organisms in a thermoneutral environment and
    in a post-absorptive state. Evolution leads to a diversity in the activities
    of organisms and the BMR levels down the impact of this diversity
    on the metabolism (fig. <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E3). It is not always possible to instantiate
    this definition; for example, ruminants are never in post-absorptive state
    (fig. <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E2).
  </li>
  <li class="itemize">
    The maximum metabolic rate (MMR) considers the maximum level
    of sustainable activity. By focusing on the upper boundary of the
    metabolism, only the determinants of this boundary are relevant and not
    the various characters involved in biological activities (fig. <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E4).
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">
  By choosing different contexts, biologists co-determine what is observed even
  when the same measurement apparatus is used to observe the same part. The BMR
  and MMR show that it is even possible to choose observations that focus on
  properties shared by different species by leveling down the weight of the
  organizational diversity stemming from history.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubsectionHead" id="342----choosing-or-eliminating-individuals"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-150003e4e2">3.4.2 </span> Choosing or eliminating individuals</h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Filtering of individuals is a method to control strains: breeders disregard
  animals with deleterious mutations, diseases, or other peculiarities. Sometimes,
  only minimal control over the past context and genealogy is possible. For
  example, in humans, most methods above would be unethical. Choosing
  individuals having specific characteristics and eliminating individuals with
  unwanted characteristics is an alternative method of control on the organisms
  investigated.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Filtering of individuals is possible during experiments; however, it impacts the
  meaning of the results. For example, in the case of a toxicological experiment,
  unexpected variations should be reported since they may be relevant to understand
  the effect of the chemical studied and may be investigated in other studies. However,
  if we want to study the “normal” physiology of insulin after long-term exposure to
  high-sugar diet, then it is necessary to rule out diabetic animals. Last, the
  quantities of interest cannot be measured at the expected time point in the
  case of individuals who meet an untimely death, which is an uncontrolled
  filter.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Filtering of individuals by their properties is a complementary way to control
  biological objects. Performing this filtering enables biologists to discard specimens
  which have gone through unwanted variations, or which have not gone through
  expected variations. Criteria can range from developmental anomalies, mutations,
  pathologies to animals frightened during measurement.
</p>
<h4 class="subsubsectionHead" id="343----data-acquisition"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-160003e4e3">3.4.3 </span> Data acquisition</h4>
<p class="noindent">
  Biological measurements typically provide quantities, and this process has an
  anhistorical dimension that is comparable to physics. The notion of measurement of
  classical physics is relevant in biology. When measuring a continuous quantity such as
  the velocity, the measurement is never exact and provides an interval instead of a
  single quantity (<span class="cmsy-10">§</span> <a href="#x1-50002e1">2.1</a>). Other physical notions such as reference frames can also be
  relevant. <a href="#Xdoi10e1111je15585646e2009e00909ex">Wagner</a> (<a href="#Xdoi10e1111je15585646e2009e00909ex">2010</a>) and <a href="#Xhoule2011measurement">Houle et al.</a> (<a href="#Xhoule2011measurement">2011</a>) fruitfully import concepts of
  measurement theory in biology which are relevant for the synchronic aspect of
  measurement. Since these aspects are not properly biological, we will not develop
  them further here.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The principle of variation implies that an observed feature can become ill-defined
  or acquire a different meaning. Here, biology goes beyond standard measurement
  theory since the changes of biological objects lead to a collapse of the original
  meaning of the quantities observed. For example, the heart rate is defined
  by beat-to-beat intervals, but pathological situations such as torsade de
  pointes escape the standard definition of a heartbeat, and the notion of heart
  rate becomes ill-defined. Similarly, the properties of the hind legs of the
  bipedal goat discussed above have a different meaning than in its quadruped
  counterparts.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Last, most experimental protocols in biology use control groups which are not
  subjected to the transformations investigated (<a href="#Xjohnson2002practical">Johnson &amp; Besselsen</a>, <a href="#Xjohnson2002practical">2002</a>). Control
  groups enable experimenters to assess the organization of specimens having the same
  historical origin and exposed to the same context than the organisms subjected to a
  putative difference maker. Controls enable biologists to estimate whether the results
  stem from the context, spontaneous variations, or conditions tested. Biological
  objects are labile, and control groups are the closest reference point possible to the
  objects tested.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="35----irreducibility-of-biological-variation"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-170003e5">3.5 </span> Irreducibility of biological variation</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Despite the use of methodologies providing tight control over biological objects, the
  principle of variation entails that there are always possible qualitative variations.
  Variations can impact the observed features directly, making them variable, changing
  their meaning or even possibly making them ill-defined. Populations which are too
  similar are evidence of malpractice (<a href="#XBolland10e1212">Bolland et al.</a>, <a href="#XBolland10e1212">2016</a>). When observing a given
  feature among several specimens, biologists report “not applicable” (NA) for a
  specimen when qualitative variations are too significant. For example, pathological
  heartbeats that do not follow the same sequence of events that regular heartbeats
  lead to beat-to-beat intervals that do not have the same meaning. This kind of
  departures appears for theoretical reasons and not only as a result of experimental
  errors or as the result of the improper theoretical definition of the target
  quantities.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Observable, qualitative variations can be shown experimentally even for
  clonal cells, for example as a result of asymmetries in cellular division (<a href="#XLongCai06">Cai
et al.</a>, <a href="#XLongCai06">2006</a>; <a href="#XStewart_2005">Stewart et al.</a>, <a href="#XStewart_2005">2005</a>; <a href="#XLindner_2008">Lindner et al.</a>, <a href="#XLindner_2008">2008</a>; <a href="#Xchapterdefault">Soto et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchapterdefault">2016a</a>) or for
  dynamical reasons (<a href="#X00344885783036602">Braun</a>, <a href="#X00344885783036602">2015</a>). Of course, the development of multicellular
  organisms also leads to a high level of variations. Variations occur even when
  comparing an individual with itself at another time point, even in the case of close
  time points. For example, many physiological time series are non-stationary
  (<a href="#Xwest2006medicine">West</a>, <a href="#Xwest2006medicine">2006</a>; <a href="#Xlongomont">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongomont">2014</a>). Stationary time series follow the same
  distribution over time which implies that the mean is a stable quantity. By contrast,
  non-stationarity implies that assessing the average at different times will not
  necessarily yield the same results. As a consequence, it is not possible to characterize
  an organism by precise values of physiologic quantities, and precise results are only
  valid at a specific time point.

  To sum our theoretical approach up, biological measurement has to accommodate

<p class="noindent">
  The role of matter in experiments is critical to their epistemological analysis
  (<a href="#Xvirtexp">Morgan</a>, <a href="#Xvirtexp">2002</a>). In physics, theories define objects mathematically, by invariants and
  invariant preserving transformations. This epistemological structure justifies that the
  same theoretical object can be instantiated independently <span class="cmti-10">de novo</span>. For example,
  the speed of light in the vacuum can be assessed on two independent light
  beams: it is an invariant of the theory. By contrast, biological objects stem
  from an history. It follows that empirical knowledge in biology cannot be
  abstracted from concrete material objects (tokens) materializing this history. In
  this perspective, biological phenomena display a radical materiality (<a href="#Xsoto2016century">Soto
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xsoto2016century">2016b</a>). Our discussion on biological measurement illustrates this idea.
  Biological names, in systematics, are not defined by a theoretical construct, they
  are defined by specific specimens called name-bearing types (<span class="cmsy-10">§</span> <a href="#x1-100003e1">3.1</a>). Then,
  experimenting with individuals of a species associated with this name means
  experimenting on individuals which descend from an ancestor shared by both the
  specimens experimented upon and the name-bearing type. These specimens
  possess a diachronic, material continuity over time: the genealogy. The same
  reasoning applies to the controlled strains and cell lines; the exchange of living
  specimens between laboratories is the further materialization of this philosophical
  idea.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In general, we can distinguish between different categories of theoretical situations
  in the relationship between matter and theoretical definitions. The methods to
  reproduce observations characterize them:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate1">
  <li class="enumerate" id="x1-20002x1">
    The description of objects is generic, and the same theoretical object can
    be instantiated empirically twice without communication of matter, as
    discussed by <a href="#Xfeynman1967">Feynman &amp; Gleick</a> (<a href="#Xfeynman1967">1967</a>, chap. 4). It is the case in current
    physical theories.
  </li>
  <li class="enumerate" id="x1-20004x2">The object’s behavior is the specific result of a history.
    <ol class="enumerate2">
      <li class="enumerate" id="x1-20006x1">
        Scientists use the permanence of the material object studied. They
        may be fixed artificially. For example, the name-bearing types used
        in systematics serve as static references for future observations. They
        may also continue to change over time, for example, in the case of
        the biosphere.
      </li>
      <li class="enumerate" id="x1-20008x2">
        The objects reproduce. This property provides an exponential
        amount of objects sharing a common past. The study of living
        organisms and cells falls typically in this category (case studies such
        as types above are an exception).

<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="42----symmetry-and-symmetrisation"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-210004e2">4.2 </span> Symmetry and symmetrisation</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Symmetries play a central role in physics (<a href="#Xfeynman1967">Feynman &amp; Gleick</a>, <a href="#Xfeynman1967">1967</a>; <a href="#Xvan1989laws">Van Fraassen</a>, <a href="#Xvan1989laws">1989</a>; <a href="#Xbailly2011">Bailly
&amp; Longo</a>, <a href="#Xbailly2011">2011</a>; <a href="#Xlongomont">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongomont">2014</a>) and will enable us to provide a more
  in-depth analysis of biological measurement. Symmetries are transformations which
  do not change the relevant aspects of a given object. For example, the equation
  describing free fall does not change for an experiment performed one century ago or
  today. Time translation is a transformation that does not change the theoretical
  description of the object: a symmetry. Moreover, the same equation applies regardless
  of the nature of the object which is another fundamental symmetry. For
  example, concerning free fall, if experimenters replace an iron bead with
  another one, or a copper or wood bead, the phenomenon remains the same:
  permuting (interchanging) these objects is a symmetry. Symmetries can be
  either exact, in the sense that they stem from fundamental principles, or
  approximate.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The concept of experimental reproducibility is a notion of symmetry. The
  reproducibility of an experiment means that the same set of observations can be
  performed by different observers, on different material objects, at different times and
  places.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Moreover, in a given experiment, biologists typically use different specimens
  exposed to the same conditions in order to perform statistical tests. The tests assume
  that these specimens follow the same probability distribution, that is, the tests
  assume that behind the quantitative variations observed there is a single abstract
  mathematical object (the probability distribution): this is again an assumption of
  symmetry.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  However, biological objects are the result of a history and continue to generate a
  history. Interpreting this notion in terms of symmetries leads to assert that when
  time flows, describing the changes of biological objects can require changes of
  symmetry that do not stem from the description of the initial objects. These changes
  are the core of the principle of variation (<a href="#Xlongo2011c">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongo2011c">2011a</a>; <a href="#Xchaptervariation">Montévil
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchaptervariation">2016</a>; <a href="#Xnovelty2017">Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xnovelty2017">2018</a>). As hinted to in the introduction, these variations
  conflict with the aim to perform reproducible experiments. In biology unlike
  in physics, the symmetries associated with reproducibility are not granted
  theoretically. Instead, they depend on the measurement as summarized in
  section <a href="#x1-180003e6">3.6</a>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Since biological regularities are more labile than physical ones, symmetries are not
  provided directly by the theory. Instead, they are co-established by the measurement
  process and the biological objects used. We propose to call this practical and
  theoretical operation “symmetrization”. Biologists typically work on specimens of the
  same species or more generally specimens with a shared common past. In
  experiments, they assume a partial equivalence between these specimens and
  how they are organized. In other words, biologists posit an approximate
  symmetry between the organization of different organisms and their response
  to experiments. Control over past contexts is also a symmetrization of the
  specimens studied and are often designed with this issue in mind. For example, in
  section <a href="#x1-120003e3">3.3</a>, we have discussed how biologists aim for cells <span class="cmti-10">in vitro </span>to be in a
  consistent state over time, that is to say, how biologists symmetrize cells.
  The different methods described in section <a href="#x1-90003">3</a> should be seen as different
  symmetrizations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Different symmetrizations can be performed during an experiment or even during
  data acquisition. Choosing a symmetrization or another endows the results with
  entirely different biological meanings. Figure <a href="#x1-140014">4</a> illustrates this idea and shows
  different ways to make organisms equivalent. In figure <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E1, by being in the field,
  organisms express their historically (evolutionary) relevant activities and these
  activities are diverse. In figure <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E3, different organisms are mostly restrained to
  activities that are common to them: the experimenter performs a stronger
  symmetrization by limiting the characters involved in the determination of the
  observed quantity.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  We can distinguish two kinds of symmetrization: concrete and epistemic
  symmetrizations. Concrete symmetrizations involve the action of biologists on
  objects. For example, establishing inbred strains is a concrete symmetrization of
  genomes, and the symmetrizations illustrated in figure <a href="#x1-140014">4</a> are also concrete
  symmetrizations. By contrast, epistemic symmetrizations do not change material
  objects and are limited to determining what is considered equivalent, that is to say,
  symmetric by permutation. For example, we mentioned that the position of a fetus in
  utero has measurable consequences. Taking this aspect into account or not
  corresponds to different epistemic symmetrizations. The concept of epistemic
  symmetrization is particularly relevant for statistical analyses and subsequent
  biological reasonings.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As a consequence of the principle of variation, the concept of epistemic
  symmetrization is always relevant: biologists have to symmetrize organisms which are
  not genuinely symmetric. Concrete symmetrizations occur in most experiments, but
  not in observations without experiments such as the observation of specimens in
  systematics. Performing concrete symmetrization constrains the kind of biological
  objects studied. For example, it is far easier to symmetrize cells in culture by
  maintaining unconstrained proliferation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In conclusion, biological measurement as summarized in <a href="#x1-180003e6">3.6</a> describes both the
  concrete and epistemic symmetrizations performed to obtain experimental results
  and endow them with biological meaning.

<p class="noindent">
  <a href="#XBaxendale2018">Baxendale</a> (<a href="#XBaxendale2018">2018</a>) proposes to map scientific practices on a continuum of strategies
  defined by their stances concerning reductionism. In this section, we apply a similar
  approach to measurement strategies. Our concept of biological measurement leads to
  the notion that measurement depends on symmetrizations, but symmetrizations can
  be performed more or less tightly and at different levels. To represent these
  strategies, we propose to organize measurement strategies along three axes as
  illustrated in figure <a href="#x1-220016">6</a>. In this section, we discuss only the different measurement
  strategies, and we do not imply that they necessarily succeed or that they prevent
  the joint use of other strategies.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The first axis describes whether the measurement is variable or on the opposite
  reproducible. Here, reproducibility means that the measurement generates data
  consistently with different specimens. For example, using inbred strains generally
  leads to more reproducible results than wild specimens.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The second axis describes whether the measurement targets singular or general
  objects. Working on the metabolic rate of mammals is more general than working on
  a single species by measuring wild specimens. Both are more general than outbred
  strains and <span class="cmti-10">a fortiori </span>inbred strains, where the genotype is symmetrized.
  Reciprocally, inbred strains are more singular than outbred strains and so
  on.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The last axis assesses whether the measurement defines objects coherent
  with their evolutionary past or instead whether the objects are more or
  less profoundly altered. For example, inbred strains are homozygotes for
  all genes which is not the case of mammals in their evolutionary history.
  Similarly, the basal metabolic rate is far less representative of a species past
  evolution than the field metabolic rate — but the latter depends on the
  field.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A qualitative axis emerges in this three-dimensional space, see figure
  <a href="#x1-220016">6</a>. This axis is given by the strategies which increase simultaneously the
  reproducibility, singularity, and alterations associated with the measurement.
  In other words, these strategies lose generality and alter the specimens in
  order to increase the reproducibility of the measurement. At the limit, these
  strategies aim to generate specimens which are as symmetrized as possible and
  would have the same status than the objects of physics: these strategies
  aim the genericization of biological organizations and use many methods to
  reduce diversity. For example, in the case of cells, samples are frozen to
  prevent spontaneous variations between experiments. The focus on model
  organisms at the level of the research community is also a collective strategy of
  genericization. In situations like clinical trials, on humans, genericization
  methods are limited for ethical reasons. In contrast to genericization strategies,
  other strategies on the same axis aim to gain generality and coherence with
  evolutionary history but at the cost of more variability in the results. It follows
  that these strategies face more difficulties to obtain statistically significant
  results.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In order to face the reproducibility crisis and to obtain significant results with
  fewer animals, it is common to promote strategies genericizing specimens
  (<a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilu036">Festing</a>, <a href="#Xdoi10e1093ilarilu036">2014</a>; <a href="#Xchia2005origins">Chia et al.</a>, <a href="#Xchia2005origins">2005</a>). However, these strategies bear the cost
  of studying singular organizations: the results obtained may not even be
  representative of the species studied, and we have seen that strains of the same
  species have distinct properties. Another example is that the conditions of the
  laboratory reduce exposure to pathogens in order to symmetrize the life history of
  animals studied, which is part of the alteration axis. However, this situation
  leads to immunological functions that differ from wild animals (<a href="#Xdoi10e1111je1365294Xe2010e04910ex">Abolins
et al.</a>, <a href="#Xdoi10e1111je1365294Xe2010e04910ex">2010</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The genericization of specimens aims, at the limit, to study a single, reproducible
  organization and is thus highly singular. Results may depend on the specificities of
  these organizations and their contexts in unknown ways. Therefore, these strategies
  are vulnerable to minor departures from the genericization performed initially. For
  example, performing measurement in different laboratories always involve a
  change of context despite the explicit control of many factors. Genericizations
  aim reproducibility in the sense of specimens that are very similar, but the
  reproducibility of experiments is made difficult by the lack of generality of the
  measurement.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In figure <a href="#x1-220016">6</a>, there are only two cases which are far from this axis. The first
  corresponds to measurements like the basal metabolic rate, see figure <a href="#x1-140014">4</a>E3. This
  measurement is reproducible and nevertheless general. Its downside is that the
  organisms are put in a specific state to level down the consequences of the diversity of
  the characters impacting the measured quantity. Its strategy is to symmetrize a
  shared aspect of organisms when the genericizations discussed above symmetrize
  complete organizations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Case studies are the second strategy departing from the main axis. Case studies
  focus on a single individual and reproducibility is not a goal. For example,
  <a href="#Xpatterson1981education">Patterson &amp; Linden</a> (<a href="#Xpatterson1981education">1981</a>) study the intelligence of non-human primates. To
  do so, the authors did not develop standardized conditions and protocols.
  Instead, they taught sign language to several specimens and focused on a
  particularly gifted gorilla, Koko, who mastered up to 2000 symbols. Other
  examples are works on types in systematics, the study of the bipedal goat
  discussed by <a href="#Xwest2003developmental">West-Eberhard</a> (<a href="#Xwest2003developmental">2003</a>) and the cloned sheep, Dolly, which is one
  success among 277 attempts and remained the only success for a long time
  (<a href="#Xwilmut1997viable">Wilmut et al.</a>, <a href="#Xwilmut1997viable">1997</a>). While the study of types does not involve alterations,
  teaching Koko or cloning a sheep do: case studies are diverse for the third
  axis.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Case studies are sometimes neglected by experimenters who strive to design
  reproducible experiments in order to study mechanisms. For example, the success of
  cloning Dolly without reproducing this feat led to an intense debate, especially when
  evidence accumulated that Dolly was indeed cloned from an adult cell (<a href="#Xsolter1998dolly">Solter</a>, <a href="#Xsolter1998dolly">1998</a>).
  However, in our conceptual framework, case studies have a specific epistemic role.
  They are sufficient to prove the existence of a possibility in a theoretical
  context where biological possibilities are not predefined (<a href="#Xnovelty2017">Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xnovelty2017">2018</a>).
  The bipedal goat shows the extent of developmental plasticity and studying
  a type is sufficient to defend the existence of a new species. Case studies
  can be extensive; for example, the anatomy of the bipedal goat has been
  described in details. In case studies, the analysis of a single part in several
  organisms is typically replaced by the analysis of many parts or aspects in
  a single organism. Last, the study of types in systematics plays a pivotal
  role in the general architecture of biological knowledge to name biological
  objects.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Representing different measurement strategies by the symmetrizations performed
  is fruitful. These strategies are different responses to the difficulties raised by the
  historical and varying nature of biological objects.
</p>
<h2 class="sectionHead" id="5----conclusion"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-230005">5 </span> Conclusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  Our theoretical notion of measurement accommodates how biologists manipulate
  immensely complex objects, organisms and cells typically, which are the result of a
  history and continue to produce a history by generating qualitative variations. The
  concept of biological measurement which we propose accommodates simultaneously
  the organisms or cells and their part or aspect of interest which may be quantified. In
  our framework, a measurement is relative to a history and context. To develop
  reproducible experiments, biologists observe specimens with a shared past. This
  shared past is ascertained by systematics and by direct knowledge and control of
  both their genealogy and past contexts. In the study of objects defined by their
  history, the objects which can be considered equivalent are objects having a shared
  past. In this context, we call symmetrization the concrete and theoretical operations
  which establish and posit the equivalence of different objects with more or less
  tightly controlled shared pasts and contexts. Symmetrization also includes the
  operations performed during the observation which can constrain and structure
  variability.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The notion of biological measurement is compatible with different research
  strategies and leads to a framework to map them. In this framework, we find two
  polar opposites. In one end, strategies strive to genericize biological organizations at
  the cost of studying singular organizations and altering them. To implement these
  strategies, biologists developed a plethora of methods. They expose objects to similar
  contexts and ensure that they have recent, controlled common ancestors.
  In some cases, biologists freeze samples to prevent them from undergoing
  variations between experiments. On the other end of the spectrum, the objects
  studied are more general (e.g., diverse genetically) and coherent with their
  evolutionary history, but they are also more variable. There are strategies which
  escape this opposition, for example, case studies or methods to level down the
  diversity relevant for the part studied while the rest of the organizations remain
  diverse.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Having a clear notion of what it means to access biological objects empirically is
  critical for biological knowledge. In this paper, we provide only an outline of
  biological measurement, and this notion deserves further discussions, focusing on
  both general and specific situations. Nevertheless, since our notion builds on solid
  ground, namely the theory of evolution and extensions for organisms, we hope that
  our work will be of use for further research. We have shown that biological
  measurement has significant differences with the notions of measurement in physics.
  Depending on the perspective, biological measurement may be seen as an extension
  of classical measurement in order to accommodate the historicity and variability of
  biological objects, or as a different concept altogether because the objects are not
  described theoretically by underlying equations. In all cases, acknowledging the
  specificities of biological measurement should provide new systematic ways to
  approach biological observations critically and ultimately to promote experimental
  reproducibility.
