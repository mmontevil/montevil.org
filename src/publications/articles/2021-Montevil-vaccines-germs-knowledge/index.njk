<!-- l. 45 --><p class='indent'>   Vaccines for COVID-19 have led to questions, debates (<a href='#x1-40011'>1<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref1  --></a>), and polemics on both
their safety and the political and geopolitical dimension of their use. We propose to
take a step back on both the history of this practice and how current theories in
immunology understand it. Both can contribute to providing a rational assessment of
COVID-19 vaccines.
</p><!-- l. 50 --><p class='indent'>   Vaccination is singular because it has a collective aim - sometimes even the
eradication of a human pathogen - and, at the same time, it involves a medical
procedure on individuals who are without the disease of interest. In that regard,
vaccination meets the question of trust straightforwardly. However, its political
ramification is not limited to the point-wise use of vaccine; its theoretical background
directly relates to our relationship with other animals on the one side and
microorganisms on the other.
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='x1-10001'><span class='titlemark'>1   </span> A very brief history of vaccines</h3>
<!-- l. 63 --><p class='noindent'>Domestication has led to the promiscuity of humans and several other species. Living
together means regularly exchanging microorganisms such as worms, amoeba,
bacteria, and viruses. Microorganisms can jump from one species to another,
especially when the hosts are relatively closely related evolutionarily and, therefore,
similar physiologically. The domestication of mammals entailed the emergence of new
contagious diseases for humans. Moreover, sedentary lifestyles led to an increase in
population density, and the latter determines the odds for an obligatory parasite, like
a virus, to sustain itself in a population.
</p><!-- l. 75 --><p class='indent'>   One such virus leads to smallpox. Smallpox is a dreadful disease with a 30 to 50%
death rate, leaving survivors scarred for life. Early archaeological and written records
of smallpox have been found in ancient Egypt, then China. Trade, crusades, and,
later, colonization carried the virus around the world, and it was, among other
things, central to the collapse of Amerindian civilizations, both by accidental and
purposeful contaminations. The human variant may come from cow strains -
Amerindian civilization did not domesticate cows, which explains why they were
                                                                  

                                                                  
more vulnerable to smallpox than Eurasian and African populations. In any case,
variants of the virus have elected cows, camels, monkeys, and, of course,
humans as their hosts - we will see that this point is critical to the invention of
vaccines.
</p><!-- l. 87 --><p class='indent'>   Such a dreadful disease led to the emergence of a practice called inoculation. This
procedure is daring; it requires exposing subjects to a somewhat weakened puss
sample from a sick person. The outcome was fewer chances to contract the
full-fledged disease; however, in one or two percent of the cases, inoculation led to
death. This practice probably emerged in China and propagated over the silk road.
Some evidence suggests that it may have also appeared independently in Africa.
There are also claims of Ayurvedic practice of inoculations; however, these claims
may stem from a British propaganda strategy in the early XIXth century to favor
adopting the practice.

<!-- l. 106 --><p class='indent'>   In any case, in the early XVIIIth century, inoculation was practiced in Istanbul
and witnessed by lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the British ambassador’s wife who
suffered personally from the disease. She applied it to her son and brought the
procedure back to England. Needless to say, a Turkish folk practice advocated by a
woman, even an aristocratic woman, met with some resistance; however,
the crippling effects of smallpox on society led it to widespread adoption
nevertheless. Inoculation raised debates of many kinds, including a mathematical
debate between Bernoulli and D’Alembert, on the rationality of inoculation
based on the emerging theory of probabilities, a theory initially directed
towards gambling and trade boat insurances. This debate already involved
evaluating the benefits of such a practice quantitatively by counting life
expectancies and not just the deaths attributed to the procedure and the
disease. Nevertheless, both participants advocated inoculation in practice
(<a href='#x1-40032'>2<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref2  --></a>).
</p><!-- l. 120 --><p class='indent'>   Edward Jenner introduced significant progress into this practice. He observed that
milkmaids did not contract smallpox. Therefore, instead of using human samples, he
used bovine samples, called vaccines (from the Latin <span class='ecti-1000'>vacca</span>, cow). The cow variant of
the disease was better for inoculation since it was largely benign for humans,
reducing the inoculation’s deadly side effects. Nevertheless, it was also met with
resistance, raising fears of minotaurization - the putative partial transformation into
cows.
</p><!-- l. 144 --><p class='indent'>   The step further was taken by Louis Pasteur. Epidemics were conceptualized in
Europe as spread by vitiated air, a perspective called miasma theory. This idea
notably led to the striking masks of plague doctors, filled with aromatic herbs
intended to purify the inhaled air. Pasteur’s continuous drive was to show that germs
were required for fermentation and similar processes, leading to dismiss the
concept of spontaneous generation - the notion that full-fledged living beings
appear spontaneously in the right condition, for example maggots in dead
animals. In the case of diseases, he contributed to germs theory, the notion that
microorganisms originate a category of diseases - infectious diseases. With this
framework, he generalized the process of vaccination by attenuating microbes. He
experimented firstly on animals and then humans in the case of rabies. The
generalization of vaccination was an outstanding breakthrough for public health. In
1977, a century later, vaccination reached a symbolic peak with the global
extermination of smallpox by an international effort coordinated by the World Health
Organization.
</p><!-- l. 157 --><p class='indent'>   Still, vaccination had its failures. Let us mention two very different ones. First, in
1930, contaminated vaccines against tuberculosis led to the death of 72 children in
Lübeck, Germany. Despite the investigation and prosecution that followed and
traced the problem to a laboratory mistake in Lübeck, it took 20 years for this
vaccine to be fully acknowledged as harmless. Second, despite many efforts, the
changing nature of HIV still escapes vaccine development. Therefore vaccines are
not a universal response to infectious diseases. Developing them may be
straightforward or, on the opposite, extremely challenging depending on the
pathogen.

<!-- l. 182 --><p class='noindent'>An uncomplicated observation, done already in antiquity, was instrumental to the
emergence of vaccination: survivors of an epidemic would not contract the same
disease, at least for a while. This observation led to the notion of immunity, from the
Latin “immunis”: exempt, free, not paying a share. Inoculation and then
vaccination are methods to jump-start this phenomenon without - hopefully-
contracting the disease <span class='ecti-1000'>per se</span>. The notion of immunity and the body of works on
infectious diseases founded the field of immunology. Building on Claude
Bernard’s concept of “milieu interieur” and the practical application of fighting
pathogenic germs, immunology started with a sharp distinction between the inside
and the outside and the self and non-self. The postulated immune system’s
function derived from the immunologists’ social function, fighting pathogens
invading human bodies. Other medical practices consolidated this idea, notably
organ transplants’ procedures, where a significant difficulty is graft rejection.
It is worth mentioning that the latter phenomenon is far from universal;
plants are more flexible than mammals, and grafting different species of the
same genus together does not trigger a pathological immune response in
them. The perspective of fighting against pathogen invading the “milieu
interieur” also led to systematic hygiene practices intended to eliminate germs
preventively.
</p><!-- l. 201 --><p class='indent'>   The scientific acme of the self/non-self contrast is the clonal theory developed by
Frank Macfarlane Burnet. This theory’s rationale is very close to the modern
synthesis in evolutionary biology and the automatic optimization of markets in
neoclassical economics. They are all theories of spontaneous “order” without
complexity or failures. (<a href='#x1-40053'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref3  --></a>) Burnet’s theory posits that lymphocytes’ proliferation
includes a process of generating diversity in their ability to recognize antigens
(molecules triggering an immune response). Then, lymphocytes undergo a process of
positive selection based on the antigen they recognize. When meeting an antigen
they recognize, lymphocytes proliferate. After the infection, a part of these
lymphocytes would remain sleeping; thus, an acquired immune response against
these antigens’ carriers can emerge. An addendum to this theory is that
lymphocytes undergo a negative selection process during their maturation in the
thymus. This process would eliminate lymphocytes recognizing the self, thus
leading to an immune system that would not attack it, thus providing an
immunological definition of the self. This theory also separates the so-called
innate and acquired immune responses strictly. The innate immune response
corresponds to the generic recognition of pathogen molecules retained during
evolution, while the clonal theory would explain the acquired immunity of jawed
vertebrates.
</p><!-- l. 219 --><p class='indent'>   The clonal theory builds on empirical evidence. First, lymphocyte maturation
involves random DNA recombinations, leading to the generation of a diverse immune
repertoire. Second, lymphocytes mature in the thymus, where a specific process leads
to the random production of proteins, generating a body’s chemical image. A
significant portion of the lymphocytes indeed does die in the thymus, suggesting a
kind of selection.
</p><!-- l. 229 --><p class='indent'>   The theory justifies the emergence of spontaneous order; however, this rationale is
                                                                  

                                                                  
overly simplistic, like the theories of spontaneous optimization in economics and
evolutionary biology. Let us mention a few of its shortcomings.
</p><!-- l. 237 --><p class='indent'>   Some vaccines include living microorganisms; others called inactivated vaccines,
include only chemicals from the pathogen. The latter often require an adjuvant to be
potent. From the perspective of clonal theory, this does not make sense: presenting
antigens to the immune system should be sufficient. An alternative theory, the
“danger theory,” has been proposed by Polly Matzinger to accommodate this
phenomenon, among others (<a href='#x1-40074'>4<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref4  --></a>). The central idea of this perspective is that cells
under stress produce chemicals that trigger the immune system. Therefore, a vaccine
that would not stress the body would be utterly inefficient - and therefore
inactivated vaccines require an irritating adjuvant. Conceptually, this framework
blurs the distinction between the self and the non-self, which both are no
longer well defined from the immunological perspective. Instead, stress is
central, and so is the coupling between innate and acquired immune responses,
that is to say, the coupling between evolutionary and ontogenetic memory
scales.
</p><!-- l. 252 --><p class='indent'>   Another major shortcoming of the clonal theory derives from the microbiome, our
symbiotic microorganisms, notably those living in the guts. Lynn Margulis already
showed in the sixties how the integration of a symbiont was a key factor in evolution,
namely bacteria that became mitochondria, a critical part of our cells. In the last
decades, technological progress in gene sequencing enabled scientists to “see” the
microbiome and, thus, to assess its role. Earlier accounts seriously underestimated
this role; now, biologists consider that the microbiome constitutively participates in
development and physiology. Biologists like Scott Gilbert posit that we are
holobionts, a composite of cells from different origins instead of only or primarily cells
stemming from the egg’s clonal proliferation (<a href='#x1-40095'>5<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref5  --></a>). These discoveries further shatter the
self/non-self opposition; here, the immune system and the microbiome become an
integrated system, where both parts regulate each other. They may also
enter pathological relationships, leading to Crohn’s disease, allergies, and
other pathologies. Among them, the connection between the microbiom
and neurodegenrative diseases such as Parkinson disease is a very active
field of research. This new perspective leads to a critical view of hygiene.
Being surrounded by a micro-organic desert disrupts our historical milieux
and would disorganize our immune system development. This reasoning
contributes to explain the epidemiological increase of the diseases mentioned above
(<a href='#x1-40116'>6<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref6  --></a>).
</p><!-- l. 271 --><p class='indent'>   Other theories to accommodate these observed discrepancies with the clonal
theory are worth mentioning briefly. Building on the notion of cognition, Thomas
Pradeu and others developed the notion that the immune system detects changes,
not an absolute state of affairs. This notion has been called the discontinuity theory
(<a href='#x1-40137'>7<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref7  --></a>). Like the danger theory, it accommodates better both the microbiome and the
vaccine adjuvants. Another framework emphasizes the relations between
lymphocytes, leading to mutual regulations in a network called the idiotypic network.
This perspective builds on an observation that is non-sensical from the perspective of
the clonal theory. In the thymus, lymphocytes with high avidity for proteins from the
self are selected against – which makes sense for the clonal theory. However,
lymphocytes that have insufficient avidity towards these proteins are also
selected against. In other words, auto-immunity is not just a pathological
condition; it is a constitutive part of the immune system’s physiology. In the
idiotypic network model, lymphocytes collectively regulate each other, and
                                                                  

                                                                  
lymphocytes disconnected from the network stop proliferating and thus disappear
(<a href='#x1-40158'>8<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref8  --></a>). This theory explains another discrepant fact. If we prevent lymphocyte
proliferation, the immune system loses its memory. Therefore, contra the clonal
theory, the lymphocytes that carry the immune memory are not merely
sleeping; they are actively proliferating, possibly under the idiotypic network
regulation.
</p><!-- l. 290 --><p class='indent'>   Even though these discrepant facts are mostly consensual among immunologists
and acknowledged as both facts and discrepant, they did not trigger a broad change
of theoretical framework - namely, giving up on the self/non-self distinction
and proposing a new understanding of what biological immunity is about.
It is not the place here to discuss why, and a special issue of Philosophy
Worl Democracy will address the state of theorization in current sciences.
Let us mention that those reasons include the insufficiencies of alternative
theorizations and the lack of theoretical fluency of most biologists. However, it is
worth remarking that anti-vax movements build on theoretical weaknesses,
notably the adjuvants whose role is mysterious from the clonal theory’s
perspective.
</p><!-- l. 303 --><p class='indent'>   Let us also mention that, in immunology, theorization and understanding
encounter a difficulty common in biology: concepts do not integrate well together
because of the theoretical mix of natural history and relational perspectives (<a href='#x1-40179'>9<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref9  --></a>).
Biologists may define immunology by the biological function: for example, regulating
microorganisms and possible parasites. Then, for example, some sea slugs display a
surprising and somewhat extreme immune response when they rip their head off to
get rid of a parasite-infested body, as recently discovered (<a href='#x1-401910'>10<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref10  --></a>). CRISPR-CAS9,
famous for its technological use in gene editing, also performs an immune function in
bacteria. 
</p><!-- l. 315 --><p class='indent'>   Once the function is defined, biologists identify parts that play a specific role in
this function, describing the immune system. However, what these parts do does not
fit precisely the function. For example, macrophages hunt bacteria down;
however, they also phagocyte (eat) “normal” dead cells - a process entirely
disconnected from the question of parasites. Lymphocytes that strongly
recognize molecules generated in the thymus based on the organism’s DNA are
selected against, which would define the self; however, many molecules of
the body are generated by the microbiome; therefore, this perspective is
partial. Living beings are not neatly organized like an ideal administration
or machine, with parts performing only specific functions. Instead, they
changed in evolutionary history, and the ability to generate novelties and the
subsequent lineage’s survival are the only strictly limiting factors of these
changes.
</p><!-- l. 329 --><p class='indent'>   Moreover, a central concept of biology is the distinction between homology and
analogy - a distinction based on historical reasoning. Homologous body parts come
from the same evolutionary origin, like human and cat limbs. By contrast, analogous
parts may look alike and perform a similar function, but they appeared
independently as insect and bat wings did. The field of immunology alternates
between the study of homolog parts and analog ones, which complexifies its object’s
nature. The theories mentioned above only make sense for homolog immune systems,
namely mammals immune systems, because they do not embed the historical and,
therefore, partly contingent nature of the immune system’s organization. In other
words, they typically investigate common aspects of mammals’ immune
systems and some variations of these common aspects. For example, the
                                                                  

                                                                  
self/non-self distinction only makes (limited) sense for mammals’ acquired
immune system (the notion can be extended to the jawed vertebrates at
best).
</p><!-- l. 344 --><p class='indent'>   By contrast, if we start again from the immune function, humans display
particular behaviors that contribute to regulating microorganisms with greater or
lesser efficiency, such as using plague doctor costumes, surgical masks, and
vaccines. In other words, somatic functions get performed or complemented by
artifacts in a process that Bernard Stiegler (<a href='#x1-402111'>11<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref11  --></a>), building on Lotka (<a href='#x1-402312'>12<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref12  --></a>), called
exosomatization. From this perspective, vaccines are peculiar; they contribute to
providing an efficient biological response at the first exposure to the genuine
pathogen, somewhat like the innate immune system. However, this response is
possible thanks to technics instead of biological inheritance; and it depends
on exosomatic memory instead of biological retentions (in particular DNA
sequences).

<!-- l. 367 --><p class='indent'>   However, in Stiegler’s thought, such artifacts are pharmaka, simultaneously
poisons and remedies, and require knowledge to be both shaped and used in less toxic
ways. Knowledge, here, should be understood in the broad sense; it includes academic
knowledge as well as practical know-how.
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='x1-30003'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> Knowledge, vaccines, and COVID-19</h3>
<!-- l. 380 --><p class='noindent'>Let us now discuss how the question of knowledge and vaccines meet in the case of
the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this question, we will focus on the case of
France that we know better. Some of its characteristics seem to represent other
western countries well, especially European ones, despite specific twists and
turns.
</p><!-- l. 389 --><p class='indent'>   Let us begin with one of those. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, firstly
reacted to the pandemic by stating that “we are at war.” Philosophers and medical
doctors alike have rightfully criticized this attitude; however, two of its ramifications
have not been discussed as such.
</p><!-- l. 397 --><p class='indent'>   The US senator Hiram Johnson famously asserted that “the first casualty,
when war comes, is truth.” Here, truth need not be understood in a robust
philosophical sense but by opposition to duplicity and, later, its industrialization as
propaganda. The French government used several rather short-lived lies to escape
difficulties, such as masks or testing capacities shortages, and it endorsed
a normative role on truth and practical rules. More importantly, policies
systematically used one of the newest propaganda methods, nudging, to
shape people’s behavior, as emphasized by Barbara Stiegler (<a href='#x1-402513'>13<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref13  --></a>). Nudging
is a method to bend behaviors without the subject knowledge and used
by applications such as Über to orient drivers’ behaviors, provided that
they are not employees; that is, they are not in a relation of contractual
subordination. Nudging is more broadly associated with libertarian paternalism
(<a href='#x1-402714'>14<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref14  --></a>). By contrast, critics emphasize the French government’s incapacity to
capitalize on the inhabitant’s knowledge and capacities and, a fortiori, to
promote their emergence. Understandably, based on this poor epistemic
relationship, the government’s words on vaccines do not carry much weight.
Simultaneously, in the last decades, repeated scandals have crippled the trust
in the pharmaceutical industry and its scientific collaborators. Here, we
cannot help but recall Kant’s concerns on lying being the downfall of speech
itself.

<!-- l. 425 --><p class='indent'>   The war paradigm’s second ramification is that wars are periods of technological
acceleration, where designs produced earlier enter industrialization, sometimes with
shortcuts in their assessments. In the COVID-19 pandemic, this perspective is very
relevant, as exemplified by the notion of a screen new deal coined by Naomi Klein
(<a href='#x1-402915'>15<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref15  --></a>). The use of remote conferencing could feed big-data systems development. Thus,
the pandemic provides a technological alternative to digital surveillance as a data
source. The technological acceleration is also very relevant for the vaccines
themselves. Indeed, the first vaccines to appear on the market are a new kind of
vaccine, called RNA vaccines.
</p><!-- l. 437 --><p class='indent'>   Interestingly, these vaccines come from the technological lineage of attempts
toward gene therapy. One of the shortcomings of gene therapy is that they trigger an
immune response. This fault led to the idea of using these technics for vaccination.
Let us briefly recall that DNA are long-lasting molecules transmitted from one
generation to the next and are a crucial medium of biological heredity. By contrast,
messenger RNAs are short-lived, unstable molecules that are an intermediary
between DNA and proteins in cellular protein production. The principle of RNA
vaccines is then to inject RNA into cells so that the cell itself produces some of
the pathogens molecules (let us recall that classical vaccines are parts or
weakened versions of the pathogen). The so-called central dogma of molecular
biology is a strangely named theoretical assumption stating that “information”
flows from DNA to RNA and then from RNA to protein and never back.
Following this dogma, RNA vaccines would not impact DNA. A caveat is
that this dogma dates back to the sixties and has since been proven wrong.
Nevertheless, being wrong in general does not imply that it is wrong in this
particular case. Like in the case of immunology, the lack of recent theorization to
accommodate discrepant facts prevents an accurate assessment of RNA vaccines’
effects.
</p><!-- l. 455 --><p class='indent'>   Empirical investigations partially compensate for these theoretical shortcomings;
however, these investigations have several weaknesses. First, they are very limited in
the time window considered - for obvious reasons. A substantial empirical
investigation strategy could have partially compensated for this shortcoming with
animal models (their life cycles can be far shorter than humans); however, no such
program has been organized to our knowledge. Pharmaceutical companies have just
organized clinical trials to meet standard regulation criteria, and public research has
been mostly confined to the usual circuits of grants proposal, sometimes just
hastened. In other words, there was no political will to know what we need to know,
a kind of <span class='ecti-1000'>abulia sciendi</span> of the political establishment concerning these matters. This
situation can be contrasted with the French minister of research’s recent attempt to
launch an extensive investigation on “Muslimo-leftism” (islamo-gauchiste)
in academia - a request met with scorn by academic representatives of all
stations.
</p><!-- l. 472 --><p class='indent'>   Second, controlled clinical trials are limited in the diversity of cases encountered
(<a href='#x1-403116'>16<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref16  --></a>). The latter limitation is universal to all clinical investigations of new drugs or
procedures, so they require a follow-up to understand possibly somewhat rare side
effects - the use of a drug in the general population is the fourth stage of clinical
trials from an epistemic perspective. The case of COVID-19 RNA vaccines is
particular since it involves exposing huge populations to an entirely new compound in
a short amount of time. The odds of long terms detrimental effects seem low, but the
exposed population is enormous. In this discussion, as emphasized by Canguilhem,
                                                                  

                                                                  
we should not forget that medicine, here extended to public health, is an art and
not a science. Judgment is required to assess the benefits and the risks. To
mitigate the latter, it seems sensible to use a diversity of vaccines at the
population level and, for young people, to adopt more classical vaccines than RNA
ones.
</p><!-- l. 486 --><p class='indent'>   Using a diversity of vaccines has another benefit. SARS-Cov-2 is far from static; it
has many available hosts to reproduce in, and biological reproduction goes with
variations; thus, the virus diversifies. Concerns about variants escaping a vaccine can
be mitigated if we use a diversity of vaccines, especially if they build on different
aspects of the virus. Biological uniformity is highly vulnerable to pathogens,
while diversity creates barriers in the population, and if a strain escapes a
vaccine, only the part of the population that has used this vaccine needs to
react.
</p><!-- l. 497 --><p class='indent'>   This rationale is not limited to the case of vaccines; it is relevant at the
ecosystemic level. Biotic homogenization due to biodiversity loss and intensive animal
farms greatly facilitates the emergence of infectious diseases, and they do emerge at
an accelerated rate (<a href='#x1-403317'>17<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref17  --></a>). The field of disease ecology has established this
point before the emergence of COVID-19, and it is probably part of the
SARS-COV-2 appearance explanation. In other words, biodiversity contributes to
constraining potential pathogens outside the body, as the immune system does
inside the body. Moreover, as mentioned in the previous section, our immune
systems are disrupted by the changes in our milieux, probably leading to the
observed epidemiological increase in allergies and autoimmune diseases, among
others (<a href='#x1-40116'>6<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref6  --></a>). Vaccines only induce somatic retentions that lead to a faster
response to the targeted pathogen. They contribute to the interplay between
humankind and microorganisms in the Anthropocene context; however, they
are not the more general care that our immune systems and ecosystems
require. Discourses that polarize the debate between irrational anti-vaccine
positions and putative rational pro-vaccine positions without including the
above considerations are characteristic of an instrumentalization of sciences.
They follow their results when they are in line with the establishment -
the deployment of technologies is usually welcome - and ignore scientific
conclusions when they have more subversive ramifications for the current social
and industrial state of affairs. The same critical view is relevant to vaccine
patents that prevent a worldwide vaccine strategy, unlike for smallpox. Again,
the unbalanced use of science contributes to the distrust that disrupts its
contribution.
</p><!-- l. 518 --><p class='indent'>   Moreover, unlike smallpox which affected equally all social groups, severe
cases of COVID-19 are particularly prevalent among underprivileged groups.
Richard Horton argues that COVID-19 is not a pandemic but a syndemic,
a disease where biological and environmental causes are interwoven (<a href='#x1-403518'>18<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref18  --></a>).
Comorbidities to COVID-19 do not stem simply from poverty; instead, they stem
from the preexisting pandemics of non-communicable diseases. A fair part
of the latter derives from unhealthy commodities for which “the vectors
of spread are not biological agents, but transnational corporations” (<a href='#x1-403719'>19<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref19  --></a>).
More broadly, consumer capitalism went with the destruction of practical
knowledge and its replacement with prescriptions following the industries’ needs:
the consumption of its productions. Amartya Sen, frequently quoted by
Bernard Stiegler, emphasized that male life expectancy in Bangladesh during a
famine was higher than in Harlem and coined the concept of capacity to
                                                                  

                                                                  
understand the Bangladeshi population’s resilience, a form of practical knowledge
(<a href='#x1-403920'>20<!-- tex4ht:ref: ref20  --></a>).
</p><!-- l. 533 --><p class='indent'>   Taking all these elements into account, COVID-19 is more a symptom than a
disease, and vaccines are symptom-relieving drugs, not a cure. The XXIst century
will be complicated, scientists say. The damaging epistemic clumsiness of scientists,
populations, and political leaders alike is characteristic of the response to COVID-19;
to do better, theoretical accuracy and a new alliance of scientific and popular
knowledge is required.
