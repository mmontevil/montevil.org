  <p class="indent">Symmetries play a major role in physics, in particular since the work
by E. Noether and H. Weyl in the first half of last century. Herein, we
briefly review their role by recalling how symmetry changes allow to
conceptually move from classical to relativistic and quantum physics. We
then introduce our ongoing theoretical analysis in biology and show that
symmetries play a radically different role in this discipline, when compared
to those in current physics. By this comparison, we stress that symmetries
must be understood in relation to conservation and stability properties,
as represented in the theories. We posit that the dynamics of biological
organisms, in their various levels of organization, are not “just” processes,
but permanent (extended, in our terminology) critical transitions and,
thus, symmetry changes. Within the limits of a relative structural stability
(or interval of viability), qualitative variability is at the core of these
transitions.</p>

<p class="noindent">
  A synthetic understanding of the notion of organism requires drawing strong
  correlations between different levels of organization as well as between the global
  structure and the local phenomena within the organism. These issues should govern
  any systemic view on biology. Here, we sketch an approach in which the
  living state of matter is interpreted as a permanent “transition”, conceived
  as an ongoing or <span class="cmti-10">extended </span>and <span class="cmti-10">critical </span>transition. A large amount of very
  relevant work pertaining to the Theories of Criticality in physics has been
  successfully applied to biology (see below). The mathematical core of these theories
  rests upon the idea that a “phase transition,” which can be either critical or
  not, may be described as a <span class="cmti-10">point </span>along the line where the intended control
  parameter runs. For example, the ferromagnetic / paramagnetic transition
  takes place for a precise value of the temperature, the Curie temperature.
  Mathematically, this is expressed by the “pointwise” value of this temperature, i.e.,
  one mathematical point in this parameter’s space. When the temperature decreases
  and passes through that point, the magnetic orientation organizes along one
  direction and magnetism appears. When the temperature increases through that
  point, disorder prevails and magnetism disappears. A (phase) transition is
  critical when some observables, or their first or second derivatives, diverge.
  This corresponds to the appearance of a “coherent structure”, that is to say
  space and/or time correlations at all scales leading to a fractal geometry.
  As a result, at the transition point, the new physical object possesses a
  “global” structure. These ideas are relevant to the analysis of biological
  organisms.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In contrast to known critical transitions in physics, biological entities should not
  be analyzed just as transient over a point of a phase change; instead, they
  permanently sustain criticality over a non-zero interval and this with respect to many
  control parameters (time, temperature, pressure). This represents a crucial
  change of perspective. First, the mathematical tools used in physics for the
  analysis of criticality, i.e, the renormalization methods, essentially use the
  pointwise nature of the critical transitions. Secondly, <span class="cmti-10">symmetries </span>and <span class="cmti-10">symmetry
</span><span class="cmti-10">breakings </span>radically change when enlarging the mathematical locus of criticality
  from one point to a non-zero interval. These symmetry changes make a key
  theoretical difference with respect to the few cases in physics where the
  transition seems extended (see footnote 10, below). Our approach may be seen
  as a move from physics to biology by an analysis of the radically different
  symmetries and symmetry breakings at play in their respective theoretical frames.
  Thus, we will mostly focus on physical vs biological criticality in terms of
  symmetries and then apply this method to the analysis of the difference
  between physical and biological “objects” as well as of physical vs biological
  “trajectories”.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Living entities are not “just” processes, but something more: they are lasting,
  <span class="cmti-10">extended critical transitions</span>, always transient toward a continually renewed structure.
  In general, physical processes do not change fundamental symmetries: to the
  contrary, they are mostly meant to preserve them. Typically, conservation properties
  (of energy, of momentum) are symmetries in the equations of movement. Critical
  transitions are an exception to the preservation of symmetries in physics;
  their “extension” radically changes the understanding of what biological
  processes are. This perspective also proposes a possible way of overcoming a key
  issue in the analysis of the complexity of the living state of matter. As for
  the construction of physico-mathematical or computational models, it is
  difficult to take the global structure of an organism into consideration, with its
  correlations between all levels of organization and in all lengths, including
  the many forms of integration and regulation. Thus, the complexity of the
  living unity is often modeled by the stacking of many but <span class="cmti-10">simple </span>elementary
  processes. Typically, these formal systems deal with many observables and
  parameters. Since the framework is classical in a physical sense, these variables
  are local, i.e. they depend on pointwise values of the intended phase space.
  Instead, conceptual and mathematical dependencies in biology should be
  dealt with as “global” ones, where variables may depend on systemic or
  <span class="cmti-10">non-local </span>effects. In physics, these dependencies are a relevant aspect of
  critical transitions, and they are even more so in biology, where criticality is
  extended.

<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="11-hidden-variables-in-biology"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-40001e1">1.1 </span>Hidden variables in biology?</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  In classical and relativistic physics, once the suitable “phase space” and the
  equations that mathematically determine the system are given, the knowledge of the
  pointwise position-momentum of the intended object of analysis allows to describe <span class="cmti-10">in
</span><span class="cmti-10">principle </span>the subsequent dynamics. This is “in principle” since physical measurement,
  which is always approximated, may produce the phenomenon of <span class="cmti-10">deterministic
</span><span class="cmti-10">unpredictability</span>, in particular in the presence of non-linear mathematical
  determination<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn1x0" id='fn1x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[1]</sup></a></span>.
  Moreover, not all “forces” in the game may be known and there may be
  “hidden variables” (like the frictions along the trajectory of bouncing dice).
  Yet, these theories are deterministic and, once all pertinent variables and
  forces are assumed to be known, it is the <span class="cmti-10">epistemic </span>lack of knowledge
  which yields classical randomness. <span class="cmti-10">Per se</span>, a dice follows a “geodesic”.
  This is a unique, optimal and “critical” path, completely determined by
  the Hamiltonian and may be computed as an optimum of a Lagrangian
  functional.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn2x0" id='fn2x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[2]</sup></a></span>.
  This very beautiful paradigm, which may be summarized as the “geodesic principle”,
  may be further grounded on <span class="cmti-10">symmetries </span>by an analysis of conservation principles (see
  Bailly and Longo (<a href="#citee0@bailly2011">2011</a>) for a recent synthesis and references).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In order to compare this situation with other fields of physics and subsequently to
  biology, we refer to the pointwise or local nature of the mathematical variables.
  Cantorian (and Euclidian) points are <span class="cmti-10">limit </span>conceptual constructions; that is, they are
  the limit of a physical access to space and time by an always approximated
  measurement, i.e., an “arbitrarily small” interval. Yet, their perfect theoretical
  “locality” makes all classical dynamics intelligible (in principle). So, if something
  is unknown, one expects that by adding enough observables and/or more
  variables with definite values at any given time, one could increase knowledge,
  since the values of these observables are intrinsic and independent of the
  context.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The situation is rather different in Quantum Mechanics. The simultaneous,
  perfect, pointwise knowledge of position <span class="cmti-10">and </span>momentum (or energy <span class="cmti-10">and </span>time) are, in
  principle, forbidden because indeterminacy is intrinsic to the theory. Moreover,
  suppose that two quanta interact and form one system and that they later separate
  in space. Then acquiring knowledge regarding an observable quantity by performing a
  measurement on one of these quanta produces an instantaneous knowledge of the
  value of the measurement made on the other, i.e., the two quanta are “entangled”
  (Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen <a href="#citee0@EPR">1935</a>). These features of the theory have several
  consequences: for instance, variables cannot always be associated to separated points
  and quantum randomness is intrinsic (under the form of Schrödinger equation, the
  “determination” gives the <span class="cmti-10">probability </span>to obtain a value by measurement). Within this
  theoretical framework, quantum randomness differs from the classical one: two
  interacting dice which later separate obeying independent statistics, while the
  probability values of an observable of two previously interacting quanta are
  correlated. This is the so called “violation of Bell inequalities”, which has been
  empirically verified repeatedly since the experiments described in Aspect,
  Grangier, and Roger (<a href="#citee0@Aspect">1982</a>). Quantum entanglement requires considering some
  phenomena as being “non-local” and unseparable by any physical measurement
  (“non-separability”).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Since the ’30s, some have found this situation unsatisfactory and have searched
  for “hidden variables” like in the epistemic approach to randomness and
  determination of classical and relativistic physics. The idea is that these hidden
  variables corresponding to quantum mechanical observables have definite
  (pointwise/local) values at any given time, and that the values of those variables are
  intrinsic and independent of the device used to measure them. A robust result has
  instead shown that these assumptions contradict the fundamental fact that quantum
  mechanical observables need not be commutative (Kochen and Specker <a href="#citee0@Kochen">1967</a>).
  Moreover, even when assuming the existence of, or the need for, hidden variables,
  these would be “non-local” and thus, far from the pointwise/local dependence of
  set-theoretic variables.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The difference between the classical and quantum frameworks has the following
  consequence: quantum systems may have a proper systemic unity for at least two reasons.
  Conjugated observables (position and momentum) are “linked” by joint indetermination,
  and entangled quanta remain a “system”, in the sense of their non-separability by
  measurement<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn3x0" id='fn3x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[3]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Can this perspective help us in biology? On technical grounds, surely not, or
  rather not yet. Perhaps, “entangled molecular phenomena” or “tunnel effects … in
  the brain” may clarify fundamental issues in the future. However, theoretical ideas in
  Quantum Mechanics may at least inspire our attempts in systems biology, in
  particular by considering the methodological role of symmetries and symmetry
  breakings in this area of physics.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A living organism is a system. And entanglement, non locality, non-separability,
  superposition, whatever these concepts may mean in biology, may present themselves
  both at each specific level of organization and in the interactions between
  levels of organization. Physiological interactions among molecules, cells,
  tissues, organs  do not simply sum each other up: they are “entangled”,
  “non-local”, “non-separable” … they are “superposed” (see examples described
  by Noble (<a href="#citee0@noble2006">2006</a>) and Soto, Sonnenschein, and Miquel (<a href="#citee0@soto2008">2008</a>)). Thus, the
  theoretical and mathematical approaches to biology cannot be based only on a
  continual enrichment of “local” views: mathematical models cannot work
  just by assuming the need for more and more variables (possibly hidden to
  the previous models). A global view of the system and of its symmetries is
  required, which requires, among other, specific analysis of measurement
  (Montévil <a href="#citee0@montevilmeasure">2019a</a>). In this context, the differences in symmetries and their
  breakings will help in clarifying and facilitating the passage from physics to
  biology.
</p>
<h2 class="sectionHead" id="2-symmetry-and-objectivation-in-physics"><span class="titlemark"  id="x1-50002">2 </span>Symmetry and objectivation in physics</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  In Physics, objectivity is obtained by the co-constitutive use of experiments and
  mathematized theories. So far, however, there is little mathematics for a
  “theory of the biological organisms” despite the large amount of data collected
  and of theories proposed within specific levels of organization. These results
  include the geometric analysis of the fractal structures of lungs, of vascular
  systems, of various plant organs, of networks of neural cells, of tumor shapes, to
  name but a few. To make further progress towards mathematizing theories
  in biology, in particular towards theories of the “living object” or of the
  organism as a system, it would help first to understand how such a feat was
  achieved in physics. Physical theories have very general characteristics in their
  constitution of objectivity, and in particular in their relationship with mathematics.
  In order to define space and time, as well as to describe physical objects,
  physicists ultimately use the notion of symmetry. Physical symmetries are the
  transformations that do not change the intended physical aspects of a system in a
  theory. As we shall see, they allow to define these aspects in a non-arbitrary
  way.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Galileo’s theory provides a simple and historical example of this role of
  symmetries. For scholastic physics, the speed at which a body falls is proportional to
  the space traveled. Galileo instead proposed that it is proportional to the time of the
  fall and that it is independent of the nature (including the mass) of the empirical
  object considered (Galileo’ law of gravitation). This idea together with the “principle
  of inertia” has been a starting point for the constitution of <span class="cmti-10">space </span>and <span class="cmti-10">time </span>in
  classical physics. More precisely, as a consequence of the analysis of inertia and
  gravitation, the geometry of space and time was later described by the Galilean
  group<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn4x0" id='fn4x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[4]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A change of this symmetry group, for example by adopting the Poincaré
  group<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn5x0" id='fn5x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[5]</sup></a></span>,
  can lead to a radically different physical perspective, that of special relativity
  involving massive conceptual and physical changes. The “principle of relativity”
  states that the fundamental laws of physics do not depend on the reference system;
  they are actually obtained as invariants with respect to the change of reference
  system. A specific speed (the speed of light in the void) appears in the equations of
  electromagnetism. Einstein modified Galileo’s group in order to transform this speed
  into an invariant of mechanics, which turned time-simultaneity into a relative
  notion.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As a result of the role and implications of symmetries, most contemporary
  physical challenges lead to the search for the right symmetries and symmetry
  changes, such as the efforts to unify relativistic and quantum theories. In moving
  from physics to biology we suggest here to apply a similar approach (symmetry
  changes).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Since the 1920s, due to Noether’s theorems, symmetries lead to the mathematical
  intelligibility of key physical invariant quantities. For example, symmetries by time
  translations are associated with energy-conservation, and symmetries by space
  rotations are associated with the conservation of angular momentum. Thus,
  conservation laws and symmetries are in a profound mathematical relation.
  Consequently, the various <span class="cmti-10">properties </span>that define an object (mass, charge, etc.) or its
  <span class="cmti-10">states </span>(energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc.) are associated to specific
  symmetries which allow these quantities to be defined. Depending on the theory
  adopted, this conceptualization allowed to understand why certain quantities
  are conserved or not: for example, there is no local energy conservation in
  general relativity. This explicit reference to the theory adopted is required
  in order to produce “scientific objectivity”, <span class="cmti-10">independently </span>of the arbitrary
  choices made by the observer, such as, the choice of time origin, the unit of
  measurement, etc, but <span class="cmti-10">relatively </span>to the intended theory. Thus, we say that
  symmetries provide “objective determinations” in physics (Bailly and Longo
  <a href="#citee0@bailly2011">2011</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The symmetries that define physical properties allow us to understand the
  physical object as <span class="cmti-10">generic</span>, which means that any two objects that have the same
  properties can be considered as physically <span class="cmti-10">identical</span>; in a sense, they are
  symmetric or invariant (interchangeable) in experiments and in pertinent
  mathematical framework (typically, the equations describing movement). For
  example, for Galileo, all objects behave the same way in the case of free
  fall, regardless of their nature. Moreover, symmetries allow the use of the
  <span class="cmti-10">geodesic principle, </span>whereby the local determination of trajectories leads to the
  determination of the full trajectory of physical objects through conservation laws.
  For example, the local conservation of the “tangent” (the momentum) of
  trajectories, typically yields the global “optimal” behavior of the moving
  object; that is, it goes along a geodesic. Thus, in classical or relativistic
  mechanics, a trajectory is unique and fully deterministic (formally determined). In
  quantum mechanics the evolution of the state or wave function (roughly, a
  <span class="cmti-10">probability distribution</span>) is fully deterministic as well – and determined by
  Schrödinger’s equation – while measurement follows this probability distribution
  (and here appears the indeterministic nature of quantum mechanics). In
  conclusion, by symmetries, the trajectory of a generic classical or quantum
  physical “object” corresponds to a critical path: physical trajectories are
  <span class="cmti-10">specific</span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  To better understand the problem of <span class="cmti-10">general </span>mathematical theorizing in biology, let’s
  further analyze how, in physics, a concrete problem is turned into robust models and
  mathematics. To begin with, physicists try to choose the right theoretical framework
  and the relevant physical quantities (properties and states) which are constituted by
  proper symmetries. As a result, typically, a mathematical framework is obtained,
  where one can consider a generic object; in classical mechanics, a pointwise object of
  mass 
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mi>m</mi>
  </math>,
  velocity 
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mi>v</mi>
  </math> and
  position 
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mi>x</mi>
  </math>,
  where these variables are generic — a pleonasm. Now, a generic object will follow a
  specific trajectory determined by its invariants obtained by calculus. A measurement
  is then made on the experimental object to determine the quantities necessary to
  specify where this object is in this mathematical framework, namely, what is its
  mass, initial position and speed. And finally, what specific trajectory will the object
  follow … at least approximately. In classical or relativistic physics, to a specific
  measurement will correspond generic objects localized near the measurement due to
  the limited precision of this measurement. This value may have, in principle, an
  arbitrary high precision. In quantum mechanics, as we recalled above, the equational
  determination (Schroedinger’s equation) yields the dynamics of a probability
  law<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn6x0" id='fn6x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[6]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In classical dynamics, we face a well-known problem: the specific trajectories
  corresponding to a measurement can either stay close or diverge very rapidly. The
  linear situation corresponds to the first case, whereas the second situation is called
  “sensitive to initial conditions” (or chaotic, according to various definitions). Note
  that even the latter situation leads to the definition of new invariants associated to
  the dynamics: in other words, the attractors that have a precise geometrical
  structure. In both cases, these trajectories have robust properties with respect to the
  measurement. In quantum physics, the situation is more complex because the
  measurement is not deterministic. Yet, when approximations on the state function
  are performed, it leads to usually stable. robust statistics. In all cases, “robust”
  means invariant or approximately invariant in a definite mathematical sense, as
  concerns the measurement of states and properties of generic objects along specific
  trajectories. Thus, we can finally say that generic objects, which lead to a specific
  measurement, <span class="cmti-10">behave </span>in the same way or approximately so. Notice that this
  property of robustness, allowed by the genericity of the object, is mandatory
  for the whole framework to be relevant. We insist that both genericity for
  objects and specificity for trajectories (geodesics) depend mathematically on
  symmetries.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In conclusion, in the broadest sense, symmetries are at the foundation of physics,
  allowing us to objectivize space and time, and constitute objects and trajectories. In
  their genericity, these objects follow specific trajectories associated with invariants
  that are robust with respect to measurement.

<h2 class="sectionHead" id="3-symmetry-breakings-and-criticality-in-physics"><span class="titlemark"  id="x1-60003">3 </span>Symmetry breakings and criticality in physics</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  The physics of criticality is a relatively novel discipline that analyzes, typically by the
  renormalization techniques, some peculiar phase transitions, i.e., state changes (see
  Toulouse, Pfeuty, and Barton (<a href="#citee0@toulouse1977introduction">1977</a>) and Binney et al. (<a href="#citee0@Binney">1992</a>)). This theoretical
  framework has also been applied to a possible understanding of life phenomena (see
  for example, Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (<a href="#citee0@Bak88">1988</a>) and Jensen (<a href="#citee0@Jensen">1998</a>), as for
  “self-organized criticality”; or, S. A. Kauffman (<a href="#citee0@stuart1993origins">1993</a>), as for criticality in networks).
  We will next move towards biology through a different insight into the symmetries in
  criticality.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Since symmetries are at the core of the definition of the physical objects by their
  properties and states, a <span class="cmti-10">symmetry change </span>(that is, the breaking of some symmetries
  and the formation of new ones) means a qualitative change of the object considered,
  or a change of physical object, understood as co-constituted by theory and empiricity.
  For example, a research program in cosmology is to consider a single force to have
  existed in the universe right after the big bang. Then, the four fundamental
  forces would have appeared by successive symmetry breakings, whereby some
  transformations, which were symmetries, did not preserve the object invariance
  anymore. In other words, with the cooling of the universe, the system moved to a
  smaller symmetry group. Closer to the scale of biology, materials like water or iron
  have different properties in different situations. Depending on the temperature and
  pressure, water may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. When liquid, there is no
  privileged direction (the system is isotropic, that is to say symmetric by
  rotations), whereas ice has a crystalline structure with spatially periodic patterns.
  This structure implies that the system is no longer symmetric by continuous
  rotations: it has a few privileged directions determined by its crystalline
  structure and a smaller symmetry group. Similarly, iron can have paramagnetic
  behavior (the system is not spontaneously magnetic) or ferromagnetic behavior
  (it is). In most cases, one can distinguish a more disordered phase at high
  temperature, where entropy dominates, and a more ordered phase, where energy
  dominates. These situations can be characterized by an <span class="cmti-10">order parameter </span>which is
  
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mn>0</mn>
  </math> in the disordered phase
  and different from 
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mn>0</mn>
  </math> in
  the ordered phase<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn7x0" id='fn7x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[7]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Now, in physics, the change of state, or <span class="cmti-10">phase transition</span>, occurs always
  mathematically at a point of the parameters’ space. This point, called the <span class="cmti-10">critical
</span><span class="cmti-10">point</span>, is intuitively associated with a sudden change of behaviour due to a
  change of symmetry, and ultimately to singularities of the state functions
  (for example, the order parameter is non-analytical because it goes from a
  <span class="cmti-10">constant </span>0 to a finite quantity, <span class="cmti-10">by a finite change</span>). More technically, the
  <span class="cmti-10">critical point </span>represents a singularity in the partition function describing the
  system<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn8x0" id='fn8x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[8]</sup></a></span>.
  In the case of iron’s paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition, this allows to deduce the
  divergence of some physical observables, such as magnetic susceptibility. It
  should be remembered that this notion of <span class="cmti-10">singularity, </span>which is associated
  with infinite quantities at the critical <span class="cmti-10">point</span>, is a core notion for physical
  criticality.

  These properties are the key motivations for the biological interest of this part of

  Now, a power law depends on a quantity without physical dimension
  (
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mi>α</mi>
  </math> in
  the notation above). These quantities involved in critical transitions are
  called <span class="cmti-10">critical exponents </span>and describe how the change of scale occurs. In our
  terminology, they describe the properties due to the objective determination of a
  phase transition because they are the invariants associated with the scale
  symmetry.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Specific analytical methods, called renormalization methods, are used to find
  these quantities (Delamotte <a href="#citee0@delamotte2004hint">2004</a>; Longo, Montévil, and Pocheville <a href="#citee0@Longo_2012_From">2012</a>). These
  methods consist in analyzing how scale changes transform a model representing the
  system, and this analysis is made “asymptotically” toward large scales. One may
  deduce the critical exponents from the mathematical operator representing the
  change of scale. The key point is that a variety of models ultimately lead
  to the same quantities, which means that they have the same behavior at
  macroscopic scales. Thus, they can be grouped in so-called <span class="cmti-10">universality classes</span>.
  This analytical feature is confirmed empirically, both by the robustness of
  its results for a given critical point and more stunningly by the fact that
  very different physical systems happen to undergo the same sort of phase
  transitions; that is, they are associated with the same critical exponents, thus
  with the same symmetries. Finally, there exist fluctuations at all scales,
  which means, in particular, that small perturbations can lead to very large
  fluctuations.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  To conclude, the transition through a specific point of the parameters’ space,
  i.e., a transition between two very different kinds of behavior is associated
  in physics to a change of symmetries. At this point, the system has very
  peculiar properties and symmetries. Symmetries by dilation (by a coefficient
  
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline">
    <mi>λ</mi>
  </math> as
  above) yield a scale invariance. This latter invariance is associated to a global
  determination of the system and the formation of a “structure of coherence”. As
  observed above, this allows to describe a global determination of local phenomena
  and a unity that by-passes the idea of understanding the global complexity as the
  sum of many local behaviors by adding more and more local, possibly hidden,
  variables. For some physical phenomena this theoretical framework presents peculiar
  and very relevant forms of “systemic unity” (Longo, Montévil, and Pocheville
  <a href="#citee0@Longo_2012_From">2012</a>).

<h2 class="sectionHead" id="4-symmetry-breaking-and-the-biological-object-extended-criticality"><span class="titlemark"  id="x1-70004">4 </span>Symmetry breaking and the biological object: extended criticality</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  We have presented a picture of the situation in physics, but what about biology? We
  need to propose one or several specific frameworks relevant to the unity and
  coherence of biological entities, because, to our knowledge, there are no
  formalized theories of the “organism” (Noble <a href="#citee0@Noble01012008">2008</a>; Soto, Longo, et al. <a href="#citee0@soto2016century">2016</a>).
  To do so, it may be worthwhile to look at the symmetries which may be
  involved in biological theorizing. Here, the concept of symmetry is used in a
  more fundamental context than when used, for example, for “bauplans”,
  the latter being the main biological research subjet where the concept is
  explicitly applied. In physics, one mostly deals with <span class="cmti-10">fundamental </span>or <span class="cmti-10">theoretical</span>
  symmetries as typically given by the equations. For example, the already
  mentioned fundamental principle of energy conservation corresponds to a time
  translation symmetry in the equations of movement. This use of symmetries also
  justifies the soundness of empirical results: Galilean inertia is a special case of
  conservation of energy and it may be empirically verified. In biology, as in any
  science, a missing analysis of invariants may give unreliable results and data.
  The current reproducibility crisis may be analyzed in this context (Begley
  and Ioannidis <a href="#citee0@Begley116">2014</a>; Montévil <a href="#citee0@montevilmeasure">2019a</a>). For example, early measurements of
  membrane surfaces gave very different results, since their measure is not a
  scale invariant property: as in fractal structures, it depends on the scale of
  observation<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn9x0" id='fn9x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[9]</sup></a></span>.
  In other words, in physics, both the generality of equations and the very objectivity
  of measures depend on theoretical symmetries and their breakings, such as scale
  invariants and scale dependencies.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As mentioned above, critical transitions in physics are mathematically analyzed as isolated
  points<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn10x0" id='fn10x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[10]</sup></a></span>.
  In our approach to biological processes as “<span class="cmti-10">extended </span>critical transitions”,
  “extended” means that <span class="cmti-10">every point </span>of the evolution/development space
  is near a critical point. More technically, the critical points form a
  dense<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn11x0" id='fn11x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[11]</sup></a></span>
  subset of the multidimensional space of viability for the biological process.
  Thus, criticality is extended to the space of all pertinent parameters and
  observables (or phase space), within the limits of viability (tolerated temperature,
  pressure and time range, or whatever other parameter, say for a given animal),
  see Bailly, Gaill, and Mosseri (<a href="#citee0@bailly1993">1993</a>), Bailly and Longo (<a href="#citee0@bailly2008">2008</a>), and Bailly
  and Longo (<a href="#citee0@bailly2011">2011</a>). In terms of symmetries, such a situation implies that
  biological objects (cells, multicellular organisms, species) are always close
  to <span class="cmti-10">a transition between different symmetry groups</span>; that is, they are in
  transition between different phases, according to the language of condensed
  matter<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn12x0" id='fn12x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[12]</sup></a></span>.
  These phases swiftly shift between different critical points and between different
  <span class="cmti-10">physical determinations </span>through symmetry changes. Several work begin to explore
  this notion mathematically (Sarti, Citti, and Piotrowski <a href="#citee0@sarti2018differential">2019</a>; Montévil
  <a href="#citee0@montevilprinciple">2019c</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Our perspective provides an approach concerning the mathematical nature of
  biological objects as a <span class="cmti-10">limit </span>or asymptotic case of physical states: the latter may
  yield the dense structure we attribute to extended criticality only by an
  asymptotic accumulation of critical points in a non-trivial interval of viability
  — a situation not considered by current physical theories. In a sense, it
  is the very principles grounding physical theories that we are modifying
  through an “actual” limit. Thus, a biological object is mathematically and
  fundamentally different from a physical object because it may be characterized
  in terms of partial but continual changes of symmetry within an interval
  of viability, as an extended locus of critical transitions. In particular, this
  mathematical view of “partial preservation through symmetry changes” is a
  way to characterize the joint dynamics of <span class="cmti-10">structural stability </span>and <span class="cmti-10">variability</span>
  proper to life (Montévil <a href="#citee0@montevilprinciple">2019c</a>; Montévil <a href="#citee0@montevilentropy">submitted</a>). We thus consider this
  characterization as a tool for the mathematical intelligibility of fundamental
  biological principles: the global/structural stability is crucially associated with
  variability.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A first consequence of these permanent symmetry changes is that there are very
  few invariants in biology. Mathematically, invariants depend on stable symmetries.
  Structural stability in biology, thus, should be understood more in terms of
  <span class="cmti-10">correlations of symmetries within an interval of the extended critical transition,</span>
  rather than on their identical preservation. It is clear that the <span class="cmti-10">bauplan </span>and a few
  more properties are more preserved than others. Yet, in biology, theoretical invariants
  are continually broken by these symmetry changes. A biological object (a
  cell, a multicellular organism, a species) continually changes symmetries,
  with respect to all control parameters, including time. Each mitosis is a
  symmetry change because the two new cells are not identical. This variability,
  under the mathematical form of symmetry breaking and constitution of new
  symmetries, is essential both for evolution and embryogenesis. The interval of
  criticality is then the “space of viability” or locus of the possible structural
  stability.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The changes of symmetries in the dense interval of criticality, which provide a
  mathematical understanding of biological variability, are a major challenge
  for theorizing. As a matter of fact, we are accustomed to the theoretical
  stability warranted by the mathematical invariants at the core of physics. These
  invariants are the result of symmetries in the mathematical (equational)
  determination of the physical object. This lack of invariants and symmetries
  corresponds to the difficulties in finding equational determinations in
  biology<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn13x0" id='fn13x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[13]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As a further consequence of our approach, phylogenetic or ontogenetic trajectories
  cannot be defined by the geodesic principle, since they are not determined by
  invariants and their associated symmetries. These latter are continually changing in a
  relatively minor but extended way.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Biology may be considered to be in an opposite situation with respect to physics:
  in contrast to physics, in biology, <span class="cmti-10">trajectories </span>are <span class="cmti-10">generic </span>whereas <span class="cmti-10">objects </span>are <span class="cmti-10">specific</span>
  (Bailly and Longo <a href="#citee0@bailly2011">2011</a>). That is, a rat, a monkey or an elephant are the <span class="cmti-10">specific</span>
  results of <span class="cmti-10">possible </span>(generic) evolutionary trajectories of a common mammal ancestor
  — or each of these individuals is <span class="cmti-10">specific</span>. They respectively are the result of a unique
  constitutive history, yet a possible or <span class="cmti-10">generic </span>one (Bailly, Gaill, and Mosseri <a href="#citee0@bailly1993">1993</a>;
  Bailly and Longo <a href="#citee0@bailly2011">2011</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The evolutionary or ontogenetic trajectory of a cell, a multicellular organism or a
  species is just a <span class="cmti-10">possible </span>or <span class="cmti-10">compatible </span>path within the ecosystem. The genericity of
  the biological trajectories implies that, in contrast to what is common in physics, we
  cannot mathematically and <span class="cmti-10">a priori </span>determine the ontogenetic and phylogenetic
  trajectory of a living entity be it an individual or a species. In other words, in
  biology, we should consider <span class="cmti-10">generic </span>trajectories (or possible paths) whose only
  constraints are to remain compatible with the survival of the intended biological
  system. Thus, phylogenesis and embryogenesis are <span class="cmti-10">possible</span>, or at least <span class="cmti-10">not impossible</span>
  paths subject to various constraints, including of course the inherited structure of the
  <span class="small-caps">dna</span>, of the cell and the ecosystem. The <span class="cmti-10">specificity </span>of the biological object, instead, is
  the result of critical points and of symmetry <span class="cmti-10">changes </span>of the system considered
  <span class="cmti-10">along its past history</span>, both evolutionary and ontogenetic Montévil, Mossio,
  et al. <a href="#citee0@chaptervariation">2016</a>; Longo <a href="#citee0@Longo2018">2018</a>. These constitute the specific “properties” of this
  object, which allow to define it. A rat, a monkey or an elephant or their
  species are <span class="cmti-10">specific </span>and cannot be interchanged either as individuals nor as
  species. A living entity is the result of its history and cannot be defined
  “generically” in terms of invariants and symmetries as it is done for physical
  objects and actual empirical practices cannot avoid this fact (Montévil
  <a href="#citee0@montevilmeasure">2019a</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  This situation has a particular meaning when we consider time translation and
  time reversal symmetries. In physics, time symmetries correspond to the maintaining
  of the system’s invariant quantities that define the geodesics, as for example,
  conservation of energy. In biology both symmetries are broken. In particular,
  evolutionary and ontogenetic paths are both irreversible and non-iteratable; there is
  no way to identically “rewind” nor “restart” evolution or ontogenesis. This
  corresponds to the breaking of time translation and reversal symmetries. In
  particular, this lack of time symmetries is associated with the process of
  <span class="cmti-10">individuation</span>, understood here as the specificity of cells, organisms and species (as
  much as this latter notion is well defined). It is crucial to understand that time
  plays a key role in this framework, since the <span class="cmti-10">history </span>of all the changes in
  symmetry are not reducible to a specific trajectory in a given space of the
  dynamics.

<p class="indent">
  Biological processes are more “history based” than physical processes. Usual
  physical processes preserve invariants, whereas extended critical transitions are a
  permanent reconstruction of organization and symmetries, i.e., of invariants. This
  situation also points to a lack of symmetry by permutation. For example,
  even in a clonal population of bacteria, different bacteria are not generic,
  because they are in general not interchangeable, i.e., they cannot be permuted.
  This allows to understand biological variability in a deeper way than the
  usual Gaussian (or combination of Gaussians) as random distribution of
  a set of observables. Now, let us consider organs (and organelles). Some
  organs have a functional role that can be expressed in a physical framework,
  particularly as far as energy transfer is concerned. This functional role can lead to
  constraints on the variability of the cells that constitute the organ, while
  the same could be said for individual organisms in populations. At least
  for certains aspects of their behaviour and on average, these constraints
  make cells behave symmetrically. In other words, those cells behave, in part
  and approximately, like generic objects with specific trajectory (geodesics).
  For these aspects, they may be interchangeable, like physical objects, to an
  extent.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The simple case of cells secreting a protein such as erythropoietin (<span class="small-caps">epo</span>) under
  specific conditions indicate that on average, a sufficient amount of the protein must
  be produced, independently of the individual contribution of each cell (which become
  “relatively” generic). Since the result of these cells’ production is additive (linear), its
  regulation does not need to be sharp. Even if some cells do not produce
  <span class="cmcsc-10"><span class="small-caps">epo</span> </span>there is no functional problem as long as a sufficient quantity of this
  protein is secreted at the tissue level. However, when cells contribute to
  a non-linear framework as part of an organ, the regulation may need to
  be sharper. This is the case, for example, for neuronal networks or for cell
  proliferation where non-linear effects may be very important. In the latter case,
  regulation by the tissue and the organism seems to hold back pathological
  developments, like cancer, see Sonnenschein and Soto (<a href="#citee0@Society">1999</a>). This point of
  view can possibly be generalized in order to understand the robustness of
  development.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The role of physical processes in shaping organs is crucial; for example, exchanges
  of energy (or matter) force/determine the optimal (geodesic) fractal structure of
  lungs and vascular systems. Organs in an organism may even be replaced by
  man-made artifacts (as for kidneys, heart, limbs, etc.). As biological entities,
  organisms and even cells are specific or, at most, weakly generic given that they can
  be interchanged only within a given population or tissue and occasionally. In general,
  they are not generic, and by their specificity they cannot be replaced by an artifact
  — structurally.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In summary, in critical transitions one may consider variables depending on global
  processes because of the formation of coherent structures. For example, there may be
  functional dependencies on a network of interactions, which cannot be split into a
  sum of many local dependencies (local variables). Thus, the search for more variables
  would not take into account this fundamental property of biological systems,
  considered as extended critical transitions. Moreover, symmetries in physics allow to
  define generic objects which follow specific trajectories (the latter allowing to find
  invariants in terms of symmetries, which are robust regarding measurement). On
  the contrary, in biology, the continual symmetry changes lead to generic
  trajectories that remain compatible with the survival of the system. The
  generic/specific duality with respect to physics helped us understand this key issue,
  in relation to extended criticality — which is a form of “relatively stable
  instability.” In other words, this is stability under changes of symmetries
  in an interval of viability. In a sense, the biological object is also defined
  by its symmetries but in a very different way: it is the <span class="cmti-10">specific </span>result of a
  history, where its dynamics is punctuated by symmetry changes. This makes it
  “historical” and <span class="cmti-10">contingent </span>(Montévil, Mossio, et al. <a href="#citee0@chaptervariation">2016</a>; Longo <a href="#citee0@Longo2018">2018</a>; Montévil

<p class="noindent">
  In physics, criticality implies more than a pointwise symmetry change; that is, it
  requires a change on a mathematical point, as it leads to peculiar behaviors that are
  relevant to biology. The first of these properties is that criticality implies a global
  determination, instead of a simply local one. More precisely, the singularities involved
  in criticality lead to a change of the level of organization in a very strong sense. Also
  in physics, in view of the mathematical divergence of some observables, the
  singularities break the ability of the “down level” to provide a causal account of the
  phenomena and they lead to the need for a “top level” to overcome this difficulty. In
  mathematical physics, this upper level can be found in the renormalization operator
  (it is the abstract level of <span class="cmti-10">changing scale</span>). In biology, instead, the upper level is the
  functional unity of an organism. As a result, the existence of different levels of
  organization is a component of our notion of extended critical transition.
  “Downward causation” may find the right frame of analysis in this theoretical
  context.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The permanent reconstruction of these levels of organization is mathematically
  represented by the density of the critical points and by the continual change of
  determination (symmetry change) in the passage between these points within the
  interval of extended criticality.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The second property is the presence of power laws which seem to be ubiquitous
  in biology. They appear regularly especially when regulation is concerned,
  such as in cardiac rhythms (Makowiec et al. <a href="#citee0@Makowiec2006">2006</a>; Pikkujamsa et al. <a href="#citee0@pikkujamsa1999cardiac">1999</a>),

  Extended critical transitions also concern the relevant lengths of local

    A metabolic activity that is far from equilibrium and irreversible, involving
    exchanges of energy, of matter and of entropy with the environment, as
    well as the production of entropy due to all these irreversible processes,

    An anatomo-functional structuralization into levels of organization that
    can be autonomous but also coupled to each other. They are “entangled” in
    the sense defined by Bailly and Longo (<a href="#citee0@bailly2009">2009</a>) and Soto, Sonnenschein, and
    Miquel (<a href="#citee0@soto2008">2008</a>). These levels are distinguished by the existence of fractal
    geometries (membranous or arborescent), where the fractal geometries can
    be considered as the trace (or a “model”) of effective passages to the
    infinite limit of an intensive magnitude of the system (for example, local
    exchanges of energy<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn14x0" id='fn14x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[14]</sup></a></span>,
    Longo, Montévil, and Pocheville (<a href="#citee0@Longo_2012_From">2012</a>)). The different levels of organization
    induce, and are a consequence of, the alternation of “organs” and “organisms”,
    such as organelles in cells, which, in turn, make up the organs in multicellular
    organisms. Organisms stay in an extended critical transition, while organs
    are partially “optimally shaped” by the exchange of physical energy and
    matter. For example, fractal geometries essentially manifest in organs that
    are also the privileged loci of endogenous rhythms (see below). Correlation
    lengths are manifested both <span class="cmti-10">in </span>and <span class="cmti-10">between </span>these levels<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn15x0" id='fn15x0-bk'><sup class="textsuperscript">[15]</sup></a></span>.
    Likewise, the various biological “clocks” are coupled, and in some cases
    even synchronized, within and between these levels. Last, this space-time
    organization enables the interdependency between the parts of cells and
    organisms, a fundamental topic in theoretical biology (Mossio, Montévil,
    and Longo <a href="#citee0@chapterorganization">2016</a>). We described symmetries which are met for a time
    as constraints. Constraints canalize processes of transformation and we
    posited that constraints of an organism collectively maintain each other,
    leading to a circularity called closure of constraints (Montévil and Mossio
    <a href="#citee0@Montevil2015c">2015</a>).

  With the purpose of providing biological temporality with a structuring of the
  mathematical type, we will consider two other aspects as being specific to extended
  criticality.

        One dimension is classical and is parametrized according to the line
        of real numbers limited by fertilization on one side, and death on the
        other. This dimension is linked to the bio-physicochemical evolution
        of the organism in relation to an environment.
      </li>
      <li id="x1-8014x2" class="enumerate">
        The other dimension is compactified, i. e. it is parametrized on a
        circle. This second dimension is linked to the organism’s endogenous
        physiological rhythm that is manifested through <span class="cmti-10">numeric quantities
</span><span class="cmti-10">without dimension </span>such as the mean total number of heartbeats
        and respirations during the lifetime of mammals. These are the
        interesting interspecific invariants and they are “pure” numbers, <span class="cmti-10">not
</span><span class="cmti-10">frequencies </span>(they have no dimension; they are the “total number
        of …”). They become frequencies (with the inverse of time as a
        dimension), according to the average lifespan. The extra dimension is
        needed exactly because the invariant phenomenon is not defined by
        a period which has the dimension of time, but by this new invariant
        observable. For example, on average, the identical (invariant) number
        of total heartbeats give different frequencies according to the different
        lifespans of an elephant or of a mouse.

      Moreover, the temporality of extended criticality involve protention (i.e.
      pre-conscious expectation) and retention (i. e. pre-conscious memory) (Longo
      and Montévil <a href="#citee0@longo2011">2011</a>), which seems to lead to a breaking of information

<p class="noindent">
  Since ancient Greece (Archimedes’ principle on equilibria) up to Relativity
  Theory (and Noether’s and Weyl’s work) and Quantum Mechanics (from
  Weyl’s groups to the time-charge-parity symmetry), symmetries have provided
  a unified view of the principles of theoretical intelligibility in physics. We
  claimed here that some major challenges for the proposal of mathematical and
  theoretical ideas in biology depend, in principle, on the very different roles that
  symmetries play in biology when compared to physics. The unifying theoretical
  framework in biology is neither associated to invariants nor to transformations
  preserving invariants like in (mathematical/theoretical) physics. It focuses,
  instead, on the permanent change of symmetries that <span class="cmti-10">per se </span>modify the
  analysis of the internal and external processes of life, both in ontogenesis and
  evolution.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In a sense, variability may be considered as the main invariant of the living state
  of matter (Montévil, Mossio, et al. <a href="#citee0@chaptervariation">2016</a>). In order to explain it, we proposed to
  consider the role played by local and global symmetry changes along extended critical
  transitions. In extended criticality, dynamically changing coherent structures as
  global entities provide an understanding of variability within a global, extended
  stability. The coherent structure of critical phenomena also justifies the use of
  variables depending on non-local effects. Thus, an explicitly systemic approach may
  help in avoiding the accumulation of models and previously hidden variables. In
  conclusion, the notion of extended criticality provides a conceptual framework, to be
  further mathematized, where the dynamics of symmetries and symmetry
  breakings provide a new, crucial role for symmetries in biology with respect to
  physics.

  <p class='indent'>     <span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn4x0' href='#fn4x0-bk' href='#fn4x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>4</sup></a></span>Symmetries form a set of transformations that have a group structure; that is, two
   symmetries applied successively yield a symmetry and a symmetry can be inverted. Galileo’s group
   is the group of transformations that allows to transform a Galilean space-time reference system into
   another. It is interesting to notice that Galileo measured time by heartbeat, a biological rhythm; the
   subsequent theoretical and more “physical” measurement of time were precisely provided by classical
   mechanics, his invention. </p>

   it in a suitable, very abstract space, a Hilbert space (a space of mathematical functions); what
   “evolves” is a probability distribution. </p>

   obtained according to different experimental scales (microscope magnifications). One team evaluated
   the surface density of the liver’s endoplasmic reticulum at  5.7  m<sup class='textsuperscript'><span class='cmr-9'>2</span></sup>/cm<sup class='textsuperscript'><span class='cmr-9'>3</span></sup> the other at  10.9  m<sup class='textsuperscript'><span class='cmr-9'>2</span></sup>/cm<sup class='textsuperscript'><span class='cmr-9'>3</span></sup> (!).

    interval; that is, it is a limit case between critical and not critical. It presents correlations at all
    scales, as critical features, but with no symmetry changes. Thus, this particular situation is not a
    counter-example to our statement (the essentially pointwise nature of the proper physical
    transitions), in view of a lack of symmetry changes that are essential to our notion of extended
    criticality, see also Lovecchio et al. ( <a href='#cite0@soctoext'>2012 </a>). </p>
   
   <p class='indent'>     <span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn11x0' href='#fn11x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>11</sup></a></span>Here, dense means that for every small volume of the intended phase space being considered,

  <p class='indent'>     <span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn12x0' href='#fn12x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>12</sup></a></span>The dense set of symmetry groups may be potentially infinite, but, of course, an organism
    (or a species) explores only finitely many of them in its life span, and only viable ones.

  <p class='indent'>     <span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn13x0' href='#fn13x0-bk'><sup class='textsuperscript'>13</sup></a></span>In a rather naive way, some say this by observing that any (mathematized) theory
    in biology has a “counterexample”. This instability of the determination goes together
    with the “structural stability” of biological entities. This is largely due to the stabilizing
    role of integration and regulation effects between different levels of organization. The
    mathematics of extended criticality and of variants of the renormalization methods are yet to be
    developed. </p>

    exchanges within the intended topological dimension (for example, the maximization, within a
    volume, of surfaces for lungs, or of volumes for the vascular system, West, Brown, and Enquist
    ( <a href='#cite0@west1997'>1997 </a>) and Longo and Montévil ( <a href='#cite0@scaling2014'>2014b </a>)), and it may be subjected to constraints in terms
    of stericity and homogeneity, as in the cases mentioned (lung, vascular system, kidney,
    etc). </p>

    course, to the physical meaning of “quantum entanglement” as expressed by Schrödinger’s
    treatment of the state function and the inseparability of quantum measure, yet it may
    be appropriate because there is no way to isolate one of the organs mentioned above
    (e.g. put a brain in a flowerpot) and perform any reasonable physiological measure on
    it. </p>
