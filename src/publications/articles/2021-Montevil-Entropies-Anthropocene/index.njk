Abstract
</h2>
     <!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >The  Anthropocene  crisis  is  frequently  described  as  the  rarefaction  of  resources or  resources  per  capita.  However,  both  energy  and  minerals  correspond  to fundamentally  conserved  quantities  from  the  perspective  of  physics.  A  specific concept  is  required  to  understand  the  rarefaction  of  available  resources.  This concept, entropy, pertains to energy and matter configurations and not just to their sheer amount.
     </p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  However, the physics concept of entropy is insufficient to understand biological and  social  organizations.  Biological  phenomena  display  both  historicity  and systemic properties. A biological organization, the ability of a specific living being to  last  over  time,  results  from  history,  expresses  itself  by  systemic  properties, and may require generating novelties The concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination  of  these  features.  We  propose  that  Anthropocene  changes  disrupt biological  organizations  by  randomizing  them,  that  is,  decreasing  anti-entropy. Moreover,  second-order  disruptions  correspond  to  the  decline  of  the  ability  to produce functional novelties, that is, to produce anti-entropy.

<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >Despite cases of denial, citizens and governments increasingly acknowledge the Anthropocene
as a crisis. Nevertheless, this crisis requires further theoretical characterization. For example,
geological definitions of the Anthropocene mostly build on human productions that could be
found in future geological strata with indicators such as chicken bones, radionuclides, and
carbons. However, these operational definitions for stratigraphy do not contribute
much to understanding the underlying process and how to produce the necessary
bifurcations. Beyond stratigraphy, in the second “warning to humanity” signed by more
than 15000 scientists, the arguments are strong but build mostly on a single line of
reasoning. The authors exhibit quantities that are growing or shrinking exponentially
(<a 
href="#Xripple2017world">Ripple <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xripple2017world">2017</a>), and it stands to reason that such a trend cannot persist in a
finite planet. This line of reasoning is commonplace in physics and shows that a
change of dynamics is the only possibility. For example, the said quantities may
reach a maximum, or the whole system may collapse. However, are these lines of
reasoning sufficient to understand the Anthropocene crisis and respond adequately to
it?
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Several authors have specified the diagnosis of the Anthropocene. They argue that this
crisis is not a result of the Anthropos <span 
class="cmti-10">sui generis</span>, but the result of specific social
organizations. Let us mention the concept of capitalocene for which the dynamics
of capital is the decisive organizational factor (<a 
href="#Xmoore2016anthropocene">Moore</a>, <a 
href="#Xmoore2016anthropocene">2016</a>). The capital opened
the possibility of indefinite accumulation abstracted from other material objects.
Along a similar line, the concept of plantationocene posits that the plantation is the
damaging paradigm of social organizations and relationships to other living beings
(<a 
href="#Xharaway2015anthropocene">Haraway</a>, <a 
href="#Xharaway2015anthropocene">2015</a>; <a 
href="#Xdoi:10.1111/gec3.12438">Davis <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xdoi:10.1111/gec3.12438">2019</a>). In both cases, the focus is on human activities and
why they are destructive for their conditions of possibility. These accounts provide
relevant insights, but we think they are insufficient in their articulation with natural
sciences.
</p><!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   To integrate economics and natural processes, <a 
href="#Xgeorgescu1993entropy">Georgescu-Roegen</a> (<a 
href="#Xgeorgescu1993entropy">1993</a>) emphasized the
theoretical role of entropy in physics. Economists should part with the epistemology of
classical mechanics where conservation principles and determinism dominate. In
thermodynamics, the degradation of energy is a crucial concept: the irreversible increase of
entropy. Methodologically, the implication is that economists should take into account the
relevant knowledge about natural phenomena instead of working on self-contained
mathematical models representing self-contained market processes.
</p><!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   This work has been reinterpreted by <a 
href="#Xstiegler2018neganthropocene">Stiegler</a> (<a 
href="#Xstiegler2018neganthropocene">2018</a>, <a 
href="#XdisruptionEN">2019</a>). B. Stiegler argues that the
Anthropocene’s hallmark is the growth of entropies and entropy rates at all levels of analysis,
including the biological and social levels. In this paper, we will discuss several aspects of this
idea, focusing on mathematized situations or situations where mathematization is within
sight. Entropy leads to a shift from considering objects that are produced or destroyed — even
energy is commonly said to be consumed — to considering configurations, organizations, and
their disruptions.
</p><!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   We first explain why entropy is a critical concept to understand the “consumption” of
energy resources. We provide a conceptual introduction to the thermodynamic concept of
               
               
entropy that frames these processes in physics. We will also discuss resources like metals and
argue that the property impacted by biological and human activity is not their amount on
Earth but their configuration. Concentrations of metals increase when geological
processes generate ore deposits. On the opposite, the use of artifacts can disperse their
constituents. Last, compounds dispersed in the environment can be concentrated again by
biological activities, leading to marine life contamination with heavy metals, for
example.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   To address biological organizations and their disruptions, we first develop several
theoretical concepts. The epistemological framework of theoretical biology differs radically
from equilibrium thermodynamics — and physics in general. We introduce the concepts of
anti-entropy and anti-entropy production that mark a specific departure from thermodynamic
equilibrium. We show that they enable us to understand critical destructive processes for
biological and human organizations.

<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we will discuss two kinds of resources relevant to the economy and show that
the proper understanding of these resources requires the concept of entropy in the physical
sense of the word. The first case that we will discuss is energy, and the second is elements such
as metals.

<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >The stock of energy resources is commonly discussed in economics and the public debate.
However, it is a fundamental principle of physics that energy is conserved. It is a physical
impossibility to consume energy <span 
class="cmti-10">stricto sensu</span>. For example, the fall of a ball transfers
potential energy into kinetic energy, and if it bounces without friction, it will reach the initial
height again, transforming kinetic energy back into potential energy. This remark is made
repeatedly by physicists and philosophers but does not genuinely influence public discourses
(<a 
href="#Xenergymosseri">Mosseri and Catherine</a>, <a 
href="#Xenergymosseri">2013</a>). <a 
href="#Xgeorgescu1993entropy">Georgescu-Roegen</a> (<a 
href="#Xgeorgescu1993entropy">1993</a>) and authors who built on his work
are an exception.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   To dramatize the importance of this theoretical difficulty, let us mention that the increase
in a body’s temperature implies increased internal energy. Heat engines, including thermic
power plants, are a practical example of this: they transform heat into useful work
(e.g., motion). We are then compelled to ask an unexpected question. Why would
climate change and the subsequent increases in temperature not solve the energy
crisis?
</p><!--l. 83-->
   <h4 class="subsubsectionHead" id="x1-70002.1.1"> <span class="titlemark">2.1.1   </span>Thermodynamic entropy</h4>
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >The greenhouse effect keeps the energy coming from the Sun on Earth, and at the same time,
the shrink of resources such as oil leads to a possible energy crisis. The main answer to this
paradox is that not all forms of energy are equivalent.
               
               
</p><!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Let us picture ourselves in an environment at a uniform temperature. In this situation,
there is abundant thermic energy environing us, but there are no means to generate
macroscopic motions from this energy. We need bodies at different temperatures to produce
macroscopic motions. For example, warming up a gas leads to its expansion and can push a
piston. If the gas is already warm, it cannot exert a net force on the said piston. It is the
<span 
class="cmti-10">warming </span>up of the gas that generates usable work, and this process requires objects with
different temperatures.
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   An engine requires a warm and a cold source, a temperature difference. This rationale led
to design cycles where, for example, a substance is warmed up and cooled down iteratively.
These cycles are the basis of heat engines. XIXth century physicists, in particular, Carnot and
Clausius, theorized these cycles. When generating macroscopic motion out of thermic energy,
the engine’s maximum efficiency is limited, and physicists introduced entropy to theorize this
limitation.<span class="footnote-mark" id="x1-7001f1"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span>
The efficiency depends on the ratio of temperatures of the cold and the warm sources. When
the temperatures tend to become equal, the efficiency decreases and tends to zero. As a side
note, nuclear power plants use the same principle, where the warm source result from atomic
fission, and the cold source is a river or the sea. It follows that the higher the temperature of
their surroundings is, the less efficient they are. Incidentaly, it also follows that nuclear
powerplant are often close to the sea, which can lead to some problems in a context were the
sea level is expected to rise.
</p><!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   Now, let us consider warm water and cold water and pouring them together in a pot. After
some time, the water will reach a uniform temperature, and we have lost the chance to extract
mechanical work out of the initial temperature difference. This phenomenon is remarkable
because it displays a temporal direction: we have lost the ability to do something.
Theoretically, this kind of phenomenon defines a time arrow that classical mechanics
lacks.<span class="footnote-mark" id="x1-7002f2"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span>
Likewise, it is possible to generate heat out of mechanical work by friction, including in the
case of electric heaters, but, as we have seen, the opposite requires two heat sources at
different temperatures.
</p><!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   Following the first principle of thermodynamics, energy is a conservative quantity. Being
conservative is a different notion from being conserved. A conserved quantity does not change
over time in a system. For example, the number of water molecules in a sealed bottle is
conserved. This property pertains both to the quantity discussed and the nature of
the system’s boundaries. By contrast, being conservative pertains mainly to the
quantity itself. A conservative quantity can change in the intended system, but
only via flows with the outside, and the change corresponds precisely to the flow. A
system’s energy is not necessarily conserved; it can decrease if it is released outside
or increase if some energy comes from outside. The same is not exactly valid for
the number of water molecules because they can disappear in chemical reactions.
Instead, chemists consider that the number of atoms, here hydrogen and oxygen, is
conservative.
</p><!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   In this context, what is entropy? The classical thermodynamic perspective defines <span 
class="cmti-10">entropy</span>
as a quantity describing the state of a system together with other quantities like energy,
volume, …Physicists used to think of heat as the exchange of an abstract fluid, the “caloric”;
however, the possibility of a complete transformation of work into heat and the partial
conversion of heat into work is not amenable to such a definition. Nevertheless, the
notion of fluid remains partially relevant to understand what entropy abstractly is.
Entropy is proportional to the size of a system, like mass or energy. Entropy can be
exchanged, and in special conditions called reversible, entropy is conservative, like
energy.
               
               
</p><!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   However, the difference between entropy and energy is that entropy tends to
increase towards a maximum in an isolated system, following the second principle of
thermodynamics. This statement has two implications: i) entropy is not conservative in
general, and ii) the non-conservative changes of entropy are only increases. In reversible
situations, entropy is conservative. By contrast, irreversibility leads to the concept of
entropy production: a net increase of entropy that does not stem from flows with the
surroundings.
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   Here again, being conservative is not the same as being conserved, and entropy production
is the departure from entropy being conservative. <a 
href="#XNicolis77">Nicolis and Prigogine</a> (<a 
href="#XNicolis77">1977</a>) showed that a
system such as a flame can produce entropy continuously and still be stationary if the
resulting entropy flows to the surroundings. Here, the entropy of the system is conserved, but
it is not conservative. Similarly, the entropy of a system can decrease when work is
used to this end. For example, centrifugation separates compounds of a gas or a
liquid.
</p><!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   The second principle of thermodynamic also captures the idea that heat can only
go from warm bodies to cold bodies. The entropy change due to a heat exchange

is positive; that is, the energy is going from the warm body to the cold body.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   In classical thermodynamics, the central concept is thermodynamic equilibrium. At
equilibrium, there are no macroscopic net fluxes within the system and with the system
surroundings. For example, if we consider an open room, thermodynamic equilibrium is met
when temperature, pressure, and other variables are homogeneous and the same as the
surroundings. There are always exchanges of gas with the surroundings, but on average, there
are no fluxes. By contrast, <a 
href="#XNicolis77">Nicolis and Prigogine</a> (<a 
href="#XNicolis77">1977</a>) describe stationary configuration far
from thermodynamic equilibrium where there is a net flow of entropy from the system to the
surroundings.
</p><!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >   Thermodynamic equilibrium is typically the optimum of a function called a state function.
These functions are the combination of state variables appropriate for a given coupling
with the system’s surroundings. For example, entropy is maximal for an isolated
system at thermodynamic equilibrium. Another example, Helmholtz free energy
<!--l. 109--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>F</mi></math>, describes the
usable work that can be obtained from a system at constant temperature and volume. Let us discuss its
form, <!--l. 109--><math

energy, <!--l. 109--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi

temperature, and <!--l. 109--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi

the entropy. <!--l. 109--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>T</mi><mi 
>S</mi></math>
corresponds typically to the energy in the thermic form so that
<!--l. 109--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>F</mi></math> is the
energy minus the internal energy in thermic form. Spontaneously, Helmholtz’s free energy will
               
               
tend to a minimum. This property is used in engineering to design processes leading to the
desired outcome.
</p><!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   Helmholtz free energy is not the most commonly used function. Consider a battery
in ordinary conditions; its purpose is to provide electrical work to a circuit,
a smartphone, say. Part of the battery’s work is its dilation, which will push air
around it. However, this is not genuinely useful. This kind of situation leads to
the definition of Gibbs energy, the maximum amount of non-expansion work that
can be obtained when temperature and pressure are set by the surroundings,
<!--l. 111--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

<!--l. 111--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

and <!--l. 111--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi 
>V</mi> </math> is
volume.
</p><!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   In these examples, couplings with surroundings are a manifestation of technological
purposes. Sometimes, the concept of exergy is used to describe available energy in general.
Unlike Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy, exergy is not a state function because it depends on
the quantities describing the system’s surroundings, such as external temperature. In other
words, calculus on state function like free energies only depends on initial and final conditions.
By contrast, work, heat, or exergy balance depend on the transformation path, not
just initial and final states. It follows that exergy depends on circumstances and
cannot be aggregated in general. Practically, this means that the available energy of a
nuclear power plant with a given amount of nuclear fuel is not just a property of
this power plant or fuel; it depends on external temperature (precisely, water input
temperature).
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   Classical mechanics is deterministic and provides the complete trajectories of the objects
described. By contrast, thermodynamics only determines the final state of a system by
minimizing the appropriate function. Since this state is singularized mathematically as an
extremum, theoreticians can predict it. The epistemological efficacy of this theory lies
precisely in the ability to determine final states. A system can go from the initial situation to
the final situation by many paths, but the outcome is the same. Calculations are performed on
well-defined, theoretical paths, whereas the actual paths may involve phenomena such as
explosions where variables like entropy are not well-defined (they are defined again at
equilibrium).
</p><!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   Classical thermodynamics is about final states at thermodynamic equilibrium. There is no
general theory for far from thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. The study of these
situations may or may not use thermodynamic concepts. For example, biological evolution or
linguistic phenomena all happen far from thermodynamic equilibrium, but their concepts are
not thermodynamic. By contrast, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as the work of
<a 
href="#XNicolis77">Nicolis and Prigogine</a> (<a 
href="#XNicolis77">1977</a>), is a direct extension of equilibrium thermodynamics. Unlike
classical thermodynamics, these approaches need to introduce an accurate description of
the dynamics. A standard method assumes that small parts of the system are at
or close to thermodynamic equilibrium but that globally the system is far from
it.
</p><!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   To sum this discussion up, entropy is abstractly similar to fluids to an extent. This
analogy’s shortcoming is that entropy is not conservative and spontaneously tends to a
maximum in an isolated system. We do not genuinely consume energy; we are producing
entropy. However, this does not lead to a straightforward accounting of entropy
production on Earth. Earth is far from equilibrium, and its entropy is not well defined.
Locally, exergy (usable energy) is not a state function, and we cannot aggregate
exergy between systems with a different nature. Nevertheless, in comparing physically
similar, local processes, entropy production, and exergy are relevant and necessary
               
               
concepts.
</p><!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   In this context, it is interesting to note that an increase in temperature leads to an increase
in entropy. As such, if Earth’s entropy were defined, global warming would increase it. At the
same time, Earth is exposed to the cold of space vacuum and loses heat this way. The
greenhouse effect slows down this process and slows down the corresponding entropy
production (released in open space). Accordingly, if we had a machine using the heat of the
Earth’s surface as a warm source and the open space as a cold source, global warming would
lead to more usable energy. Of course, this principled analysis has no practical counterpart.
With this last example, we aim to emphasize again that the assessment of entropy and
entropy production should be performed in the context of technological or biological
processes.

   <h4 class="subsubsectionHead" id="x1-80002.1.2"> <span class="titlemark">2.1.2   </span>Microscopic interpretations of entropy</h4>
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >The thermodynamic perspective described above is somewhat abstract; however, it has two
microscopic interpretations introduced by Boltzmann and Gibbs. Debates on which of this
interpretation is more fundamental are still ongoing, and their prevalence also has
geographical differences (<a

href="#XBUONSANTE2016414">2016</a>). Despite their
conceptual differences, for large isolated systems, they lead to identical mathematical
conclusions. Moreover, both are bridges between microscopic and macroscopic descriptions.
Here, we assume that the microscopic description is classical, deterministic dynamics, and we
do not discuss the quantum case.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   Let us start with Boltzmann’s interpretation of entropy. We consider gas in an insulated
container so that its energy is constant. At the microscopic level, molecules move and bump on each
other and the container’s walls chaotically. At this level, particles are described by their positions
and velocities in three dimensions. These numerous quantities define together the microstate,
<!--l. 130--><math 
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"  
display="inline" ><mi

and the microspace, i.e., the mathematical space of possible microstates. Let us
insist that the microstate is not small; it describes all particles, numbering typically

the whole system. Then, we can define the possible macrostates. For example, we posit that
one macrostate corresponds to the molecules’ uniform distribution at a given scale and with a
given precision. We can define another macrostate where all the particles are in the container’s
corner and one that encompasses all other possibilities. Depending on the microstate

so on. The system is always in the first macrostate, even though it covers a small part of the
possible macroscopic values. This outcome stems from the combinatorics that leads an
overwhelming number of possibilities to correspond to a specific macrostate, marginalizing
alternatives.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   Second, Boltzmann assumes molecular chaos: the system explores the microspace
uniformly. It follows that the time spent by the system in a given macrostate is proportional

</p><!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >   Since one macroscopic possibility corresponds to an overwhelming part of the microspace,
the system will spontaneously go into this domain and remain there except for possible, rare,
and short-lived periods called fluctuations. The largest the number of particles,
the rarest fluctuations are. In typical situations, the number of particles is not 4
or 10000, but is closer to 1000000000000000000000; therefore, fluctuations do not

playing pool, the initial configuration is improbable, and we spontaneously think that
somebody had to order the pool balls for them to be in a triangle shape. After striking them,
their configuration becomes more uniform, and we acknowledge that it is the result of multiple
random collisions. The same qualitative result will follow if we throw balls randomly on the
table. It is the same for velocities. Initially, only the ball struck is moving, and all others are
still. After the collision, the kinetic energy is distributed among the balls until friction stops
them. Of course, the game’s goal is to go beyond randomness, and players aim for balls to
reach specific locations.

<!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >   Despite their formal similarity, Gibbs and Boltzmann’s formulations have a critical
difference. In Boltzmann’s formulation, a single microstate has an entropy: a microstate
corresponds to a macrostate, this macrostate corresponds to many microstates, and how many
define the entropy of the said microstate. By contrast, Gibbs framework is not about
individual microstates; it considers all possible microstates simultaneously, and entropy is a
property of their probability distribution. For example, when the system is isolated, and its
total energy is constant, all microstates with the same energy have equal probability, which
maximizes the entropy.
</p><!--l. 172--><p class="indent" >   In a nutshell, the entropy being maximal is a property of the state of the system for
Boltzmann. By contrast, it is a property of an ensemble of systems for Gibbs, and more
specifically, it is a property of the associated probabilities. In mathematically favorable
conditions (infinite number of particles), the outcome is the same despite this significant
conceptual difference.
</p><!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   Microscopic interpretations of entropy present a hidden challenge. Liouville’s theorem
states that the probabilities in an initial volume in the microspace are conserved over the
dynamics. It follows that this volume cannot shrink or expand over time. Taken as is, this
would mean that the entropy cannot increase over time — an embarrassing result when
aiming to interpret the second principle of thermodynamics.

<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >   The leading solution to this problem is a procedure called coarse-graining. Let us introduce
it by analogy. Does sprayed water occupy a larger volume than when it was in the
tank of a spray bottle? Once water is sprayed, a hand moved in the air affected is
going to be wet. From the perspective of the hand, water occupies a vast volume
of air. Nevertheless, the actual liquid water volume remains the same; water has
just been dispersed, not added. This example illustrates two ways to understand
the water volume: the fine-grained water volume that remains the same and the
volume from the coarse-grained perspective of the hand — this volume has increased.
Mathematically, if we partition space into boxes, all these boxes will contain some
sprayed water. This procedure is called coarse-graining. The fine-grained water volume
remains the same, but the coarse-grained volume has expanded (figure <a 
href="#x1-80022">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:coarse --></a>). In physics,
coarse-graining follows this logic; however, space and volume no longer pertain to
the three-dimensional physical space. Instead, these notions refer to the abstract
microspace that typically corresponds to all particles’ position and momenta in the
system.
</p><!--l. 187--><p class="indent" >   Technically, the microstates are not represented individually in entropy calculation
because entropy would not change over time due to Liouville’s theorem. Instead,
physicists use a coarse-grained representation of the system. The dynamics still
preserve the fine-grained volume; however, the latter deforms, gets more and more
convoluted over time, and meets more and more coarse-grained volumes (the boxes).
As a result, the coarse-grained volume increases, and so does the entropy (figure

such, so entropy can only increase.

evidence of this fact. Along the same line, in physics, the space of possible microscopic
configurations inherited from mechanics is position and momenta, and other aspects can be
added, such as molecular vibrations or chemical states.
</p><!--l. 195--><p class="indent" >   Third, the relationship between a system and its coupling is complex. We have emphasized
that exergy, in general, depends on variables describing its outside; therefore, it depends on
transformation paths and is not a state function. Even for state functions, macroscopic
systems’ descriptions depend on their couplings precisely because the state function that leads
to predictions depends on the couplings. Along the same line, with Gibbs’s interpretation, the
system’s statistics entirely depend on the couplings; it is impossible to describe the
macroscopic system without them. A change of couplings will require a change of
               
               
statistics. Boltzmann’s interpretation is more complex in that regard. The definition of
macroscopic variables and coarse-graining depend on the couplings; however, the
microscopic definitions are somewhat independent; for example, they may rely on classical
mechanics.
</p><!--l. 197--><p class="indent" >   Fourth, in a nutshell, why does an isolated system tend towards maximum entropy? Let us
imagine that the system starts in a low entropy configuration. In Boltzmann’s formulation, the
system will travel among possible microstates. Since most microstates correspond to a single
macrostate, the system will spontaneously reach and stay in this macrostate, the maximum
entropy configuration. In Gibbs formulation, the entropy is defined at equilibrium and does
not change. The system may fluctuate according to its probability distribution;
however, the entropy is about the probability distribution, not about the state. We can
still picture a system initially at equilibrium, for example, a gas in a small box,
and a change of coupling, for example, its release in a larger box. Then, the initial
distribution is not at maximum entropy, and the change of coupling will lead to
a change in distribution. Over time, the system spreads towards the equilibrium
distribution, with maximum entropy — though Gibbs framework does not describe
how.
</p><!--l. 199--><p class="indent" >   In both cases, the macroscopic description of the object goes from a particular state
towards the most generic configuration, and the increase of entropy erases the macroscopic
peculiarities of the initial configuration. It erases the past. The increase of entropy corresponds
to the spread among microstates towards more generic microstates. As such, we can interpret
it as the dispersion of energy. For example, a warm body in contact with a cold body means
that energy is concentrated in the former, while at thermic equilibrium, it is dispersed equally
among the two bodies, according to their thermic capacity. Note that the increase of entropy
is sometimes compatible with the appearance of macroscopic patterns. They can
emerge due to energetic constraints in the formation of crystals such as ice, for
example. Nevertheless, to enforce further patterns, work is required. For example, the
Earth’s gravity field pulls heavier molecules to the bottom of a room — work is
performed by gravitation, which has many implications for Earth atmosphere or toxic
gases.
</p><!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >   Last, the articulation of the invariant and perspectival properties of entropy is a complex
subject. Let us mention an interesting example given by Francis Bailly: when scientists
discovered isotopes, seemingly equivalent particles could be distinguished. The macroscopic
description changed, and so did the entropy. The decisive point is that previous predictions
still hold. For example, if gas is initially in the corner of a room, it will spread in the
room. However, we can make new predictions once we know that there are different
isotopes. For example, if we see that only a given isotope is in the corner of the
room, then we can predict that the corresponding entropy will increase and that the
molecules with this isotope will spread in the room. Therefore, there is a level of
arbitrariness in the definition of entropy; however, the arbitrary choices lead to consistent
outcomes.
</p><!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >   Along the same line, Boltzmann’s formulation depends on the definition of macrostates.
The latter depends on the coupling between the system and its surroundings. Similarly, Gibbs
entropy depends on coarse-graining, which also corresponds to the coupling between a system
and its surroundings. In all cases, macroscoping couplings define the macrocopic variables that
will determine equilibrium. Thus, entropy ultimately depends on these couplings. As a result,
<a 
href="#Xrovelli_2017">Rovelli</a> (<a 
href="#Xrovelli_2017">2017</a>) argues that entropy and the corresponding time arrow are perspectival, where
the perspectives are not merely subjective but stem from the couplings with surroundings. In
the case of technologies, the couplings’ choice depends on the device’s purpose, as discussed
above.

thanks to this energy indefinitely. We mostly agree with this perspective except on a
specific point. If the system has to materialize its own boundaries (the shell of the
spaceship or, in our primary interest, Earth’s atmosphere), these boundaries will be
exposed to the void of space and eroded — a phenomenon producing entropy. For
example, the Earth loses parts of its atmosphere continuously. However, this is more a
principled issue than a practical one, and it does not depend significantly on human
activities.
</p><!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, there is no sharp distinction between energy and matter, as demonstrated by Einstein’s

<!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" >Despite these controversies, entropy is a critical concept to understand the availability of
mineral resources. This section builds mainly on the analysis of ore deposit formation in

Here, the problem of resources is similar to energy: what matters is not the quantity of the
intended atoms existing on Earth. It is primarily their configurations.
</p><!--l. 223--><p class="indent" >   When analyzing ore deposits, the critical factor is the concentration of the intended ores.
The higher the concentration of an ore deposit is, the less chemical and mechanical
work is required to purify it to functional levels, and, accordingly, the higher its
profitability is. If the local concentration of ores in the Earth’s crust was equal to
its average everywhere, even the most common resources could not be extracted
fruitfully. Then, it is the departure from maximum entropy situations, as far as the
concentrations of ore are concerned, that is the crucial factor in analyzing mineral
resources.
</p><!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   What is the origin of the heterogeneities that leads to usable ore deposits? If we consider
               
               
lava of the Earth’s average composition in an insulated box, such deposits would not appear
spontaneously because of the second principle of thermodynamics. However, the Earth is not
in thermodynamic equilibrium. The nuclear fission of some of its components warms its
insides up — a transitory but prolonged process. Moreover, it is an open system. The
Sun provides energy on its surface. The space vacuum acts as a cold source where
energy is lost, mainly in the radiative form. Between cold sources and warm sources,
macroscopic motions occur spontaneously, leading to convection cells. They happen
in the mantle, the oceans, and the atmosphere. Convection is just an example of
a macroscopic phenomenon that occurs spontaneously in open systems far from
thermodynamic equilibrium, and specifically on Earth — Prigogne’s work mentioned above
aims precisely to analyze this kind of situation. Another example is the cycle of
water, which involves state changes, becoming alternatively liquid, gas and sometimes
solid.
</p><!--l. 227--><p class="indent" >   These various macroscopic phenomena can lead to the magnification of ore concentration,
often due to a contingent combination of processes. For example, heavy compounds tend to
sink to the core of the Earth; however, melted magma rises due to convection in the mantle. In
magma chambers, gravitation leads heavier elements to sink and thus to the appearance of
heterogeneities. Later, the resulting rocks can be submerged or exposed to rainwater, and
some compounds will dissolve. If the elements of interest dissolve, they may precipitate at a
specific location where appropriate physicochemical conditions are met, leading to an
increased concentration. Alternatively, some elements, for example, gold, may not
dissolve in most conditions, but other compounds surrounding it may dissolve and
be washed away, exposing gold and increasing its local concentration. Then, gold
nuggets can be transported by water and concentrated further in specific places in
streams — a key and iconic factor of the American gold rush. In general, ore deposits
result from such combinations of processes (<a

</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   In a nutshell, ore deposits result from macroscopic phenomena that occur on Earth because
it is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. We did not develop this case, but biotic activities
contribute also to this process. In any cases, human activities benefit from this naturally
occurring process and pursue it further by several technical or industrial methods that
produce very high concentrations in the intended element. All these processes reduce the local
entropy, but they require macroscopic work and produce entropy, which is released on the
surroundings — at the level of Earth as a whole, entropy is released by thermic
radiations.

<!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >Living beings, especially bacteria, can contribute to the formation of ore deposits by their
biochemical activities. However, there is another relevant extension of this discussion in
the biological realm. Biotic processes concentrate some compounds found in their
milieux. In the Anthropocene, these compounds are also the ones released in the
environment by industrial processes and products. The accumulation of such compounds in
biological organisms impacts their survival and the safety of their consumption by
humans.
</p><!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >   Several processes are involved in this phenomenon (<a 
href="#Xbarron2003bioaccumulation">Barron</a>, <a 
href="#Xbarron2003bioaccumulation">2003</a>). The first is the
bioaccumulation from sediments. This process is very relevant for heavy compounds that sink
to the ocean floor, such as heavy metals or microplastics. It largely depends on the behaviors
of the organisms involved. Some of them, like worms, can ingest relatively old sediments,
whereas other organisms feed at the surface of sediments.
</p><!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >   The second process is the bioconcentration from compounds present in water. Some
compounds existing in water have a higher affinity with particular organs or tissues than with
water itself. As a result, even assuming that equilibrium between intake and excretion of the
said compound is reached, they are in higher concentration in organisms than in water. For
example, lipophilic and hydrophobic compounds such as PCBs accumulate in fat
tissues.
</p><!--l. 255--><p class="indent" >   The bioaccumulation from sediments is made possible by organisms’ feeding activity, a
process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Similarly, bioconcentration from water stems
mainly from the fast chemical exchanges taking place during respiration, in gills for large
organisms. In both cases, accumulation is made possible by the specific chemical compositions
of organisms. The latter are generated and sustained by organisms — a process far
from thermodynamic equilibrium. Depending on the cases, the concentration inside
the organism can reach a balance between intake and release. On the opposite,
organisms can collect compounds in their milieu without reaching the equilibrium
concentration.
</p><!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >   The last relevant process is biomagnification in food chains. Living beings feed on each
other. Bioaccumulation from sediments and bioconcentration lead to the presence of
compounds in prey organisms. Then, these compounds become part of a predatory organism’s
food and can accumulate further in the latter. This process follows the food chain magnifying
the compound’s concentration that gets higher than in sediments and water. The
bioaccumulation of heavy metals and PCBs leads to organisms that are improper for
consumption.

distribution entropy. For many compounds of industrial origin, this process is detrimental to
the biosphere in general and humankind in particular.

chain. These processes lead to a high concentration of several compounds at the worse possible
locations for biodiversity and humankind: in the body of organisms. In these cases, the

Theoretical macrostates’ choices depend on their causal role, and the latter depends on the
couplings with surroundings. Therefore entropy also depends on the nature of these couplings.
Moreover, available energy, exergy, depends not only on the nature of the variables
involved in these couplings but also on their values. Nevertheless, some couplings and
macroscopic descriptions are generic to a large extent for technological purposes. For
example, the mobility of persons and goods leads to analyze macroscopic mechanical
couplings.
</p><!--l. 276--><p class="indent" >   In engineering, entropy typically comes into play to analyze a machine’s functioning,
starting historically with heat engines. However, machines’ long-term functioning also involves
entropy to analyze their degradation, and so does their production, as exemplified by our
discussion on mineral resources. This remark connects with the concept of autopoiesis in
biology: an organism has to maintain or regenerate its parts to last over time. Similarly,
artifacts have to be analyzed over their life cycles. In that regard, processes will always
produce entropy. The meaning of circular economy, if any, cannot be reversible cycles and
perpetual motion. The economy will always lead to entropy production; however, this
production can be mitigated by organizing far from equilibrium cycles in the economy, limiting
resource dispersal.
               
               
</p><!--l. 278--><p class="indent" >   The design of machines is also external to the analysis of functioning machines, and the

biological systems are open systems that take low entropy energy from their surroundings and
release entropy. We already discussed macroscopic movements of matter on Earth that occur
spontaneously far from thermodynamic equilibrium and sometimes lead to ore deposits

</p><!--l. 288--><p class="indent" >   Schrödinger went further and proposed to analyze biological order as negative entropy.
There are little doubts that biological organizations correspond to a low entropy insofar as we
can define their entropy. There have been several theoretical works along this line (<a

href="#XNicolis77">1977</a>; <a 
href="#Xvan2001general">van Bertalanffy</a>, <a 
href="#Xvan2001general">2001</a>). However, conflating low entropy and the concept of
organization is not accurate. Everything that contributes to the low entropy of biological
situations is not relevant for their organizations. For example, a cancerous tumor increases
morphological complexity but decreases organization (<a 
href="#Xlomososo2015">Longo <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xlomososo2015">2015</a>). Similarly,
we have discussed biomagnification and other processes that reduce the entropy
of chemicals’ spatial distribution but are detrimental to biological organizations.
Moreover, entropy is extensive; it is proportional to the size of a system. By contrast, a
biological organization’s critical parts may not amount to much quantitatively, such as a
single nucleotide change or a few molecules in a cell, which can both have significant
consequences.
</p><!--l. 293--><p class="indent" >   This kind of shortcomings led to propose another quantity to address biological
organizations: anti-entropy (<a

Anti-entropy was first a macroscopic extension of far from equilibrium thermodynamics. The
term anti-entropy stems from an analogy between the relation matter/anti-matter and
entropy/anti-entropy. Entropy and anti-entropy are similar, they have an opposite sign, and at
the same time, they have a qualitatively different meaning. They only “merge&#x0022; when the
organism dies or, more generally, when an organization collapses.

coupling between inside and outside, biology involves couplings between different levels of
organization. These couplings stem from a shared history, for example, between a multicellular

</p><!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >   In a nutshell, physicists established thermodynamics for systems where the coupling
between a system and its surroundings is well defined and is usually static, or, at least, follows
a pre-defined pattern. This framework enables engineers to control industrial processes and the

surroundings is not well defined by a sharp distinction between the inside and the outside of
the organism. It is not a theoretical invariant. Current couplings result from natural history

</p><!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >   First, in biology, physical space is broken down by membranes at all scales, from organelles
and cells to tissues, organs, and organisms. This spatial organization restricts diffusion and the
rate of entropy production. In turn, this partial compartmentation ensures that the number of
molecules remains low in compartments, such as cells, for many kinds of molecules.
Chromosomes, in particular, exist in only a few copies in each cell. We have seen with the
example of coin throwing that a macroscopic variable was stable in the case of a high
number of throws but highly random for a small number of throws. It is the same for
molecular processes in cells : the low number of many molecules leads to randomness

Unlike Boltzmann, we cannot build on the idea that microscopic possibilities would
be explored uniformly, leading towards generic configurations (the most probable
macrostate). Instead, we have to focus on how systems explore possibilities in a historical
process.
</p><!--l. 340--><p class="indent" >   If the difficulty were limited to this aspect, it would not entirely hinder mathematical
reasoning from finding generic patterns. For example, mutations without selection (neutral
mutations) lead to a random walk in the space of possible <span

class="small-caps">d</span><span 
class="small-caps">n</span><span 
class="small-caps">a</span> </span>sequences, and probability
distributions describe this process well. Its generic properties are used to assess the
genealogical proximity of different species. Similarly, we can analyze the generic properties of
large networks of interacting molecules if the interactions are generic, i.e., all have the same
nature.
</p><!--l. 343--><p class="indent" >   The heart of the theoretical problem is that this process leads to molecules with
qualitatively different behaviors. For example, molecular motors or tubulin do very different
things than enzymes. Molecular motors are molecules that “crawl” on macromolecular
               
               
structures, and tubulin are molecules that constitute fibers spontaneously. Moreover,
molecules contribute to macroscopic structures and interact with them. In this process, their
biological meanings acquire qualitative differences. For example, crystallin proteins contribute
to the mechanical integrity of the eye, and they are transparent so that they do not hinder the
flow of light.
</p><!--l. 348--><p class="indent" >   In the relevant organic and ecosystemic contexts, the specific properties of proteins impact

class="small-caps">a</span> </span>sequences. As a result, the latter differs from a random walk, and its
determinants are multiple. Moreover, historicity is relevant even for the dynamic of
neutral mutations, mutations having no functional consequences. Mutations can be
reversed or prevented by proteins that appeared historically. Similarly, reproduction
processes change in evolution, which influences all genetic dynamics, even for neutral
mutations.
</p><!--l. 352--><p class="indent" >   We consider how living beings live as the main interest of biology. Therefore, functionally
relevant changes are fundamental. In the case of mutations, biologically relevant variations are
the one that impacts biological organizations in one way or another. When we discuss the

elementary elements, like a text is a combination of letters and other symbols. If we take this
combination process alone, all patterns seem equivalent, which wrongly suggests an analogy
with Boltzmann’s hypothesis of molecular chaos. In biology, these combinations
are not biologically equivalent. They can lead to qualitative novelties and changes
in the exploration of these combinatorial possibilities. In a nutshell, not only is
the space of combinatorial possibilities massive, but the &#x0022;rules&#x0022; of the exploration
of this space depend on positions in this space — and these positions are not the
sole determinants. These rules are as diverse as functional biological processes are,
and thus they are not generic properties, instead they are historical (<a

We have proposed to invert the epistemic strategy of physics. Physics understands
changes by invariance: the equation and their invariants describe states’ changes
but do not change themselves. By contrast, in biology, we argue that variations
come first and that invariants come second; they are historicized (<a

that, unlike in physics theories, the definition of concrete experiments always has an

</p><!--l. 359--><p class="indent" >   In particular, the space of possibilities cannot be pre-stated both at the microscopic and
macroscopic levels — assuming that stating possibilities requires describing their causal
structure explicitly. For example, the space generated by protein combinatorics is
not genuinely a space of possibilities. It does not make explicit that molecules like
molecular motors or tubulin are possible. Moreover, this space is far from complete; for
example, proteins are not just amino acid sequences, and they can recruit other
elements such as iron in hemoglobin or iodine in thyroid hormones. Nevertheless, this
space is relevant: it is a space of possible combinations of amino acids. This space
is generated mathematically by the transformation defined by mutations and the
enzymes involved in transcription and translation (<a

theoretical construct is insufficient to state the possible roles of the said combinations in
               
               
biological organisms. In this regard, possibility spaces in biology are not just a way to
accommodate changes; they are a component of biological changes and are co-constructed by
them.

many organizations depend on gravitation or the physical periodicity of night/day

from their surroundings, like in flames or hurricanes. Biological organizations last for different
reasons. In the framework of the closure of constraints, organizations persist thanks to the

</p><!--l. 383--><p class="indent" >   Organizations are not spontaneous in the sense that they stem from history.
Self-organization in physics is generic; for example, convection cells always follow the same
pattern. By contrast, closure of constraints is compatible with many qualitatively different
configurations. For example, different bacteria can live in the same milieu. Reciprocally, in the
historicized epistemological framework that we have hinted to, invariants (constraints) cannot
be postulated like in physics; they require an explanation. Closure of constraints is a way to
explain the relative persistence of some constraints (<a

</p><!--l. 385--><p class="indent" >   Closure of constraints describes constraints collectively stabilizing each other. It

On the opposite, there are limits to the stability of biological organizations. For

a fluorescent protein, but with a mutation preventing the formation of the said
protein if the code is considered exact. However, protein production is not exact.
Randomness in gene expression generates a diversity of variants, including the fluorescent
protein, and bacteria presenting the mutated gene will be fluorescent (<a

<!--l. 391--><p class="noindent" >What could then be a theoretical specification of anti-entropy? First, when entropy is low,
supplementary macroscopic variables are necessary to specify the system. For example, if gas
is mostly in the corner of a room, it is necessary to specify which corner, its size,
the difference of concentration between this corner and the rest of the room, etc.
Biological situations involve this kind of supplementary quantities to describe their
properties, physiology, and life cycles, so organizations are often confused with low
entropy.
</p><!--l. 393--><p class="indent" >   To overcome this confusion, we propose to build anti-entropy on the concept of
organization as closure of constraints. Then, it is not only and not all macroscopic variables
that play a role in anti-entropy, as discussed above, but constraints of all sizes. The core
reason for this property is that small features of an organism can have large-scale
consequences.
</p><!--l. 395--><p class="indent" >   Moreover, anti-entropy aims to capture the singularity of a biological situation in the
process of individuation at all levels (evolution, ecosystems, organisms). Therefore, the
specificity of constraints — how improbable they are when we can define probabilities —
               
               
should play a central role. This specificity can then be assessed for the organization, in other
words, how specific constraints have to be to play their role in the organization.
Here, we are introducing the notion that coarse-graining, in biology, stems from
organizations.
</p><!--l. 397--><p class="indent" >   In a nutshell, we propose to consider that an element relevant for anti-entropy satisfies
three criteria. i) It contributes to organization <span

it has a systemic role in an organism’s persistence. ii) It is the specific result of
history. iii) The specific properties in (ii) are the condition for the systemic role in
(i).
</p><!--l. 400--><p class="indent" >   It follows from this definition that anti-entropy is relative to an organization. A change
that increases an organization’s anti-entropy can reduce another’s anti-entropy and even lead
to its complete collapse.
</p><!--l. 404--><p class="indent" >   There are two ways in which anti-entropy can be non-conservative. First, it can decrease.
The organization simplifies; it involves fewer constraints and more generic constraints, the
ultimate example being death. This process involves entropy production since it erases parts of
the organization that stems from the object’s history. Second, by analogy with entropy
production, we propose the concept of anti-entropy production. It corresponds to the
appearance of functional novelties, as described above. This process is time-oriented, like
entropy production.
</p><!--l. 406--><p class="indent" >   There are processes in biology that are analyzed as physical self-organization, such as
convection cells or Turing’s morphogenesis (<a

do not contribute <span

</p><!--l. 409--><p class="indent" >   Last, anti-entropy production requires producing a specific situation conveying a specific

situations are not generic outcomes; therefore, they require a work of exploration.
This exploration may involve both the new parts and broader organization changes.

<!--l. 417--><p class="noindent" >We will now discuss how this framework can contribute to understanding the Anthropocene
crisis. Let us start with an example.
               
               
</p><!--l. 420--><p class="indent" >   Seasonal variations constrain living beings and their activities. Biological responses specific
to this rhythm appeared in evolution. The internalization of seasonal rhythms is an example of
the trend to establish complex couplings that living beings exhibit, as discussed above. Many
biological events such as blooms, hatching, and migrations occur at specific times of the
year. The study of periodic events in the living world associated with seasonality is
phenology.
</p><!--l. 424--><p class="indent" >   In ecology, the “desynchronizations” of activities can break down relations between
populations in an ecosystem. These alterations and their consequences are often called
disruptions, and their study is a particularly active field of research. They are relevant
economically, socially, and for conservation biology (<a

href="#XStevenson2015">2015</a>).
</p><!--l. 427--><p class="indent" >   In this section, we argue that understanding these disruptions supposes simultaneously to
analyze i) the relations in a system and ii) the natural history which originates a specific
synchronization iii) that contributes to the populations’ viability. In other words, we think
that disruptions decrease anti-entropy.
</p><!--l. 431--><p class="indent" >   Let us describe the typical situation in more detail. If all populations would follow the
same shift, then there would be no change in their interactions. However, species use a
diversity of clues to articulate their behavior with seasons (called Zeitgeber, e.g., temperature,
snow, soil temperature, and photoperiod <a 
href="#Xvisser2010phenology">Visser <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xvisser2010phenology">2010</a>). The impact of climate change on
phenologies is diverse because, for example, climate change does not impact photoperiods but
does impact temperatures. The diversity in phenological changes impacts the possible
interactions and can destabilize ecosystems.
</p><!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >   For example, <a 
href="#Xdisruptpol">Memmott <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a> (<a 
href="#Xdisruptpol">2007</a>) modeled the disruption of plant-pollinator
interactions in an ecosystem. In this model, the notion of disruption has a precise meaning,
which the authors do not discuss. Let us describe their model. Each plant has a flowering
period, and each pollinator has a period of activity. Plant-pollinator interactions stem from
empirical data. A plants that are not pollinated are impacted negatively and so are pollinators
with periods without plants to forage on.

   </figure>
<!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >   This computational model’s outcome is that few plants are vulnerable to the change, but
many pollinators are. Plants are relatively robust because pollination can happen at any time
during their flowering period. However, pollinators are vulnerable because they need to feed
during their whole activity period, see figure <a 
href="#x1-210013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pheno --></a>.
</p><!--l. 453--><p class="indent" >   What happens in this model at a deeper theoretical level? The initial situation is in a small
part of the space of possible activity periods because all plants and pollinators are in a viable
configuration. The underlying history of these ecosystems explains that these particular
configurations exist. The condition of viability for plants and pollinators leads to a systemic
analysis of their networks of interactions at a given time. After a change in the local climate
and the subsequent, diverse phenological shifts, a significant number of pollinators
and some plants are no longer in a viable configuration. Here, the specific initial
situation transforms into a more random or &#x0022;arbitrary&#x0022; configuration concerning
the viability and Natural History. In this model, disruption is the dissipation of
history outcomes that impact the sustainability of systems parts via the ecosystem’s
interdependencies.
</p><!--l. 455--><p class="indent" >   The initial situation contributes to anti-entropy. The populations of the system contribute
to their viability by plant-pollinator interactions (i). The initial configuration is
specific because it is in a small part of the possibility space (ii). Last, this specific
configuration has an organizational meaning: in our example, all populations are
viable because of this specific situation (iii). The initial configuration meets our three
criteria; therefore, the initial configuration’s specificity is part of the ecosystem’s
anti-entropy.
</p><!--l. 457--><p class="indent" >   The final configuration is more generic than the initial one; it is more random concerning
viability criteria. Climate change leads to the loss of part of the anti-entropy. This loss
corresponds to a randomization of the configuration in the space of activity periods, that is,
an increase of entropy in this space. Moreover, this change leads to the disappearance of
populations, which means that part of the relevant variables disappears. Part of the biological
possibilities collapse.
</p><!--l. 460--><p class="indent" >   There are many other situations where similar reasonings enable scientists to
analyze disruptions of synchronicities, even though our theoretical interpretation is not
explicitly used (for example, <a 
href="#Xrobbirt2014potential">Robbirt <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xrobbirt2014potential">2014</a>; <a

href="#Xdisruptpol">Memmott
<span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xdisruptpol">2007</a>). Moreover, the discussion of anti-entropy and its decrease in disruption is
more general than the case of seasonal synchronicities. Climate change and other
changes of the Anthropocene disperse part of the anti-entropy and produce entropy at
the level of the relevant description space, that is, activity periods — the latter is
not the space of physics, position and momenta, and the corresponding entropy
is not physics entropy. The configuration after the change occupies a larger part
of the remaining description space than initially, and these configurations do not
fit with the organization of the system (in our example, not all populations are
viable).
</p><!--l. 465--><p class="indent" >   This discussion shows that biological organizations have particular vulnerabilities. They
build on regularities, in particular, the ones in their surroundings. However, these regularities
can change, and, in the Anthropocene, they change very quickly due to human activities.
Unlike in cybernetics, no feedback stabilizes these couplings, at least not on relatively short
time scales. When the surroundings change, fine-tuned organizations become randomized and
thus disorganized to an extent. A similar phenomenon occurs, for example, in the case of
endocrine disruptors. Chemical industries produce new chemicals, some of which
interfere with hormone action. Since these chemicals and families of chemicals are
new occurrences in the biosphere, there is no organized response to them. Hormone
               
               
actions are the fine-tuned result of evolution, and endocrine disruptors randomize it.
Endocrine disruptors lead to many adverse effects, both for humans and wildlife (<a 
href="#Xendocrinedisruptors">Zoeller
<span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#Xendocrinedisruptors">2012</a>).
</p><!--l. 469--><p class="indent" >   We thus have a first organizational concept for the Anthropocene crisis:
a partial loss of anti-entropy that corresponds to an increase of biological
entropy. Here, entropy is not directly the concept of physics (i.e., with

></math>): the
growth of entropy occurs for biological quantities relevant for biological organizations, for
example activity periods. The loss of anti-entropy is the loss of specific history results that
used to contribute to the current organization of organisms or ecosystems. This process leads
to their disorganization.

<!--l. 496--><p class="indent" >   The outcome is sometimes accurate, sometimes involves a loss of accuracy, and is

translation, &#x0022;burn.&#x0022; In one case, a term is replaced by a wrong, more specific one: “cook”
becomes “simmer”.
</p><!--l. 499--><p class="indent" >   What happened in this process? Google translate uses a Neural Machine Translation
System that builds on preexisting translations to find statistical patterns (<a 
href="#X45610">Wu <span class="cmti-10">et al</span></a>, <a 
href="#X45610">2016</a>).
However, these statistical patterns do not preserve meaning in all cases. For example, one
word may have two primary meanings in one language and only one in another — it may even
not have a good counterpart. Since Google Translate builds on databases, the outcome quality
depends strongly on whether the use of the word in the lexical context of its sentence preexists
in Google’s corpus.
</p><!--l. 501--><p class="indent" >   A good translator does not just rely on usual ways to translate words and sentences but
strives to convey meaning in another language. In a recipe, conveying meaning is a practical
notion: enabling the reader to perform the recipe. Of course, the stakes of a text are always
more complex, but in this case it remains a primary function. And performing this function is
not simple. Since cooking methods and ingredients are specific to a locality, translating a
recipe should not be literal; the translated text has to find its home in a different gastronomic
culture.
</p><!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >   There are many ways to convey meaning in translation. For example, the translator may
choose not to translate a word but to define it instead. The recipe used as an example is a
&#x0022;human&#x0022; translation from the French. However, in French, “Reserve aside on a plate” would be
redundant because “réserver” means to keep aside for later use and is a widely known
word; this is an implicit definition. Similarly, translating ingredients is a complex
operation because it involves substitutions for available ingredients in the target
country. Ultimately, sometimes, the only way to translate a recipe correctly involves
tests to reproduce it in a given locality. The meaning of recipes stems from the
coupling between a food production and distribution infrastructure and culinary
culture.
</p><!--l. 505--><p class="indent" >   To convey a text’s meaning, good translators often need to depart from the text and <span 
class="cmti-10">a</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">fortiori </span>from its statistical translation. The statistical translations are the ones that
maximize entropy, at least in a conceptual sense (sometimes in the technical sense of
information theory), because they are the most probable output once we have a
database of known translations. In other words, the automatic translations are the
ones that fit the most closely to preexisting patterns. By contrast, departing from
the most probable translations by a good translator involves choosing an unlikely
translation to convey meaning properly. Sometimes, the translator may even choose
not to translate a word, and this kind of choice can ultimately lead to enriching
the target language with a new word. They are part of the overall diachrony of
language.
</p><!--l. 508--><p class="indent" >   This work of the translator fits our concept of novelty (<a 
href="#Xnovelty2017">Montévil</a>, <a 
href="#Xnovelty2017">2019b</a>), thus
corresponding to the concept of anti-entropy production transposed at the linguistic and
gastronomic interface in our specific example. Let us recall that we assumed that the aim is to
enable the reader to perform the recipe and thus that cooking tests are part of the translator
tools: translation is never just a linguistic problem. Or provide another example, in poetry, a
field where performing translations is especially difficult, the musicality of the translation is
often a central factor.
</p><!--l. 512--><p class="indent" >   In a nutshell, the preservation of meaning in translation often requires introducing
               
               
novelties in the translation, akin to the production of biological anti-entropy. Like biological
novelties, they are unlikely and, at the same time, convey a specific meaning in the
intended context. By contrast, the use of automatic statistical translations leads
to a more or less significant loss of meaning because of its inability to introduce
such novelties. In this perspective, translators do not optimize the transmission of
information <span 
class="cmti-10">sensu </span><a 
href="#Xshannon">Shannon</a> (<a 
href="#Xshannon">1948</a>); instead, they add information to preserve the initial
meaning.
</p><!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >   Let us go back to the term replaced by a more specific one, “cook” becoming “simmer”. In
this specific case, even though it is not clear why this substitution took place — Japanese
cuisine does not just simmer garlic —, the situation fits the more general where deep learning
seems to introduce novelty. Another example is image upscaling with deep learning: details are
added to a photograph, such as blades of grass. In both cases, the increase in details has not
the same meaning as the original text or image. In the recipe, the addition is wrong; in the
photograph, the blades of grass are recombinations from a database, not plants from the
original scene. This fact should lead to the greatest caution when such methods
enhance scientific images used to interpret a phenomenon. In a nutshell, these kinds of
addition are not a full-fledged novelty in the sense that a translator meaningful
novelties.

<!--l. 542--><p class="noindent" >Entropy is a well-established concept in equilibrium thermodynamics. The notion of
“consuming energy” and “consuming mineral resources” are not accurate from the perspective
of physics and the concept of entropy and its derivatives are necessary to address these
phenomena. The core of this conceptual point is that, in both cases, configurations matter
more than sheer quantities. The concept of entropy leads to consider usable energy. However,
the latter depends on the couplings of a system with its surroundings, and these couplings
can be diverse. It is the case even when studying the life cycle of a given artifact,
that is, beyond analyzing one of the multiple processes of this life cycle (resources
acquisition, production, use, wear, disposal). As a result, it would make little sense
to perform a straightforward accounting of free energy and, therefore, of physics
entropy.
</p><!--l. 544--><p class="indent" >   The concept of entropy requires rigorous reasoning, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics
and theoretical biology are far from being as theoretically stable as equilibrium
thermodynamics. Nevertheless, there are definite conclusions.
</p><!--l. 546--><p class="indent" >   For example, entropy helps understanding mineral resources. Earth is an open system,
where geological processes contingently magnify the concentration of elements leading to ore
deposit formation. Once purified and used to construct artifacts, resources tend to disperse
back into the environment. For example, for tires and breaks, wear leads to the dispersal of
the components matter. Organisms may concentrate back the particles dispersed by industrial
processes again, with adverse consequences for both humankind and wildlife. Processes leading
to the increase in the concentration of elements are associated with a cost in free energy in
one form or another; again, they can happen spontaneously because Earth and the
               
               
biosphere are far from thermodynamic equilibrium and, <span 
class="cmti-10">a fortiori</span>, are open to fluxes of
energy.
</p><!--l. 548--><p class="indent" >   Equlibrium analyses are limited to a machine’s functioning or a given step in its life cycle.
By contrast, the life cycle of a machine is far from thermodynamic equilibrium because the
production and destruction of the machine are irreversible processes. Moreover, what
genuinely matters is articulating artifacts with biological, technological, and social
organizations. This point is relevant both in terms of interactions and to transfer some
questions from biology to technics and technologies. For example, artifacts also
have functions and emerge in a historical process, albeit different from biological
evolution.
</p><!--l. 551--><p class="indent" >   In biology, we have emphasized the centrality of organizations and their historical
dimension. These aspects lead to the concepts of anti-entropy and anti-entropy
production. Anti-entropy corresponds to relevant, specific parts of an organization
that are the result of history and perform a role in organizations because of that.
Anti-entropy production is the appearance of a novelty in a strong sense: an initially
improbable or even unprestatable outcome that provides a specific contribution to the
organization. It follows from these definitions that both concepts are relative to a given
organization.
</p><!--l. 553--><p class="indent" >   These two concepts lead to two kinds of disruption of biological and human organizations.
In the disruption of anti-entropy, changes lead to the loss of specific configurations
contributing to an organization. In other words, part of anti-entropy is lost in favor of more
random configurations w.r. to the biological organization. This phenomenon is the
entropization of part of anti-entropy.
</p><!--l. 555--><p class="indent" >   Second-order disruptions, the disruptions of anti-entropy production, are the loss of the
ability to generate novelties contributing to biological organizations. In the technological
examples discussed, the ability to produce specific texts or interactions conveying meaning is
disrupted by digital technologies. Similarly, biological evolution is itself the object of
disruptions in the Anthropocene.
</p><!--l. 557--><p class="indent" >   Overall, this investigation shows that the concept of entropy is critical to understand the
Anthropocene; however, its specific role ultimately depends on the analysis of relevant physical
processes and biological or social organizations. The theory of biological organization, in
particular, remains a work in progress.
