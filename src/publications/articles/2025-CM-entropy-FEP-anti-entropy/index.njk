<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>

<p>Scientists often mobilize approaches from fields other than biology
to understand living beings. However, it is not easy in biology to
apply, for example, the principles of physics, which are based on
conservation, optimization, and the pre-definition of the phase space.
Indeed, as René Thom put it, “it is the lack of the definition [of the
virtual possible] that affects - very seriously – the scientific nature
of Darwin's Theory of Evolution” (Amsterdamski 1990). Similarly, since
the discovery of the physicochemical structure of DNA as the material
support of genes, principles derived from computer science have been
widely applied to understand living organisms with a reductionist,
genocentric viewpoint. They remain so today, even if their validity has
been belied by numerous discoveries and analyses, such as the diversity
of gene reading modes, alternative splicing, epigenetics, and
developmental plasticity.</p>
<p>In this context, an interdisciplinary effort aims to rework the
conceptual framework for understanding biological organisms by following
an organicist approach that is neither physicalist nor
“informationalist”. This work has led to proposing three principles for
a theory of organisms. The principle of variation posits the historicity
of biological objects: the regularities of living beings playing a
causal role, which we call constraints, are part of a history and can
change over time. Biological objects cannot be defined based on
invariants and symmetry as in physics; we say they are specific
(Montévil et al. 2016a). The practical way of defining them is
phylogenetics, sometimes also genealogy for laboratory strains, but in
all cases, it is historical (Montévil 2019). If these objects are
initially variable, the relative stability of their constraints needs to
be explained. The principle of organization has this function: in an
organism, a constraint canalyzes a process that maintains another
constraint, which canalyzes a process, and so on, leading to circularity
called the closure of constraints (Mossio, Montévil, and Longo 2016;
Montévil and Mossio 2015). This principle also allows us to speak of
function in the sense of the relationship between a part and a whole,
defined by the circularity of the closure. Finally, we posit that the
default state of cells, i.e., their behavior when no particular cause
acts upon them, is proliferation and motility, not quiescence (Soto,
Longo, Montévil, et al. 2016). In other words, living beings do not need
stimulation to be active.</p>
<p>In line with this framework, anti-entropy has been introduced as an
addition to entropy. The term anti-entropy stems from an analogy with
anti-matter: anti-matter is symmetrical to matter, but has opposite
properties in some respects. Anti-entropy was first introduced as a
measure of phenotypic complexity and addressed through its metabolic
consequences (Bailly and Longo 2009). The idea has since been refined
based on biological variations interpreted as changes in symmetries,
i.e., what was to become the principle of variation (Longo and Montévil
2012). Finally, the most recent concept defines the production of
anti-entropy, by analogy with the production of entropy, as the
production of a functional novelty, i.e., the production of a singular
situation that contributes to the closure of an organization by this
singularity (Montévil 2021). Indeed, entropy production provides the
arrow of time of physics by the second principle of thermodynamics and
the idea that a system spontaneously moves from the being somewhat
specific to the most generic configuration, given the constraints of
that system. Biological historicity manifests a second time arrow, with
objects that can produce increasingly functional specificity.</p>
<p>In this context, many questions remain. For example, closure of
constraints does not imply that an organization remains unchanged. On
the contrary, the principle of variation means that biological
organizations can always change, but how do these changes take place? In
particular, what is the relationship between organizational change and
entropy? In the particular case where these changes correspond to
functional novelties, i.e., correspond to a production of anti-entropy,
what is their relationship to entropy?</p>
<p>These questions are met by an informational approach to biology
defining the "free energy principle" (FEP). Schrödinger, in his book
"What is Life?" (Schrödinger 1944), proposed that the primary
characteristic of living systems is repelling entropy while maintaining
their internal order. Similarly, the info-computational vision of the
FEP understands the organization of living systems as the result of a
computational process based on the minimization of entropy. The FEP aims
to provide a mathematical framework for the temporal evolution of a
living system and that of its model of "beliefs" in terms of Bayesian
updates optimized to fit the statistics of the things to which the
system is coupled (Ramstead et al. 2023). This theory states that living
systems seek to minimize the variational free energy corresponding to
the relative entropy of the system's generative model. This
info-computational approach provides a self-organizing model of the
living world, where organisms are made of layers of nested abstract
representations generating probabilistic decisions (Kirchhoff et al.
2018).</p>
<p>The FEP is mainly used in neuroscience to formalize the leading
theory in this field, namely the Bayesian brain theory. According to
this theory, the brain actively infers the causes of its sensations and
selects actions to minimize entropy relative to its subject. Thus, the
Bayesian generative model of the brain updates and evolves by maximizing
the evidence for its beliefs (Friston, Kilner, and Harrison 2006). The
FEP is a variational principle, posited as equivalent to the principle
of least action, fundamental in physics, and the principle of maximum
entropy, but applying to Bayesian mechanics as a "physics of and by
beliefs" (Ramstead et al. 2023). This informational principle states
that living systems tend to optimal maintenance and adaptation to their
environment by organizing themselves against entropy. According to
proponents of this theory, it applies to all living beings, even those
without nervous systems, and even to all evolutionary phenomena,
biological (Kuchling et al. 2020; Kirchhoff et al. 2018; Campbell 2016)
and societal (Slijepcevic 2024). Thus, according to some of its
advocates, it is a candidate for "a great unifying theory"
(Sánchez-Cañizares 2021).</p>
<p>As argued in the first section, the FEP is incompatible <em>ex
hypothesi</em> with the organicist framework we are helping to develop,
as it develops an informational approach to living things and lean on
optimization principles (Bailly and Longo 2011; Longo et al. 2012).
Nevertheless, the FEP and its critique allow us to work on the
relationship between entropy, organization and changes in organization
(Chollat-Namy and Longo 2022).</p>
<p>We begin with a general presentation of the literature on FEP as a
principle of cognition and organization at all levels of living
organisms. We then turn to the paradoxical and much-discussed case of
the brain under the influence of psychedelics. This case is interesting
since the organizing principle of the FEP is challenged by an increased
cerebral entropy, which nonetheless seems to induce beneficial changes
at both neurological and psychological levels.</p>
<p>Building on this paradox, we will criticize the FEP, first pointing
out some general difficulties in applying information concepts in
biology, then more specifically on the physicalist assumptions of the
FEP, notably the existence of a predefined phase space. The aim will not
be to reject all the ideas put forward by FEP theorists but to
demonstrate some of their limits and contribute to overcoming them by
proposing an organicist theoretical alternative based on current work in
this field.</p>
<p>By analyzing entropy within living systems, we will add to the
concept of anti-entropy, explaining how a biological system's
disorganization can enable its reorganization and evolution towards new,
viable, and not only unpredictable but also "unprestatable"
configurations; that is, the changes are not just about a state among
predefined possible states, but the possibilities themselves are
unpredictable. This approach will lead us to rediscuss the default state
of life and the notions of causality and finality in biology outside a
physicalist paradigm.</p>

The principle of free energy and its application to biological
organization</h3>

<p>Many researchers have argued that algorithmic information processing
by living systems is essential to their stability and survival (Walker
and Davies 2013), and involves capturing information about their
environment, then translating this information into exploitable and
adaptive actions. It has been suggested that this process is the
defining characteristic of living organisms and would be uniquely
oriented towards maintaining organisms in their expected phenotypic and
ontogenetic state (Kirchhoff et al. 2018).</p>
<p>This maintenance objective is achieved by the free energy principle,
according to which living systems seek to minimize a theoretical
quantity of information called "free energy," corresponding to the
entropy relative to the system and its coupling to its environment.
According to this theory, any biological organization, in particular the
nervous system, creates statistical approximations, Bayesian generative
models, corresponding to a hierarchical system of "beliefs" about the
causes of its sensory data (Knill and Pouget 2004; Friston, Kilner, and
Harrison 2006; Friston and Kiebel 2009). A system minimizes its free
energy when it implicitly optimizes its "belief" about what provokes
sensory input. In other words, a living system actively infers and
projects hypotheses about the causes of its sensations and selects
actions to minimize the relative entropy about them. This free energy is
also called "uncertainty," "surprise," or "prediction error," and
minimizing it is equivalent to maximizing the evidence for the belief
model (Kiverstein, Kirchhoff, and Froese 2022). This localized control
of entropy would act as a "driving force" for the adaptive
reconciliation of living systems with their environment and thus towards
their stability.</p>
<p>In this sense, the FEP implies that all living systems, considered to
be endowed with cognition, can be modeled as visiting a limited set of
states in order to continue to exist (Parr and Friston 2019). This
modeling uses information geometry techniques that formally specify the
boundary between a living system and its external environment, notably
as a Markov blanket (Palacios et al. 2020). A Markov blanket is based on
a statistical partitioning between internal states (systemic) and
external (environmental) states. The Markov blanket includes a second
partitioning between active and passive sensory states, mediating
exchanges between internal and external states (Ramstead et al.
2021).</p>
<p>This info-computational and cognitivist vision of the living world,
based on Bayesian model generation through FEP action, is applied beyond
the brain (Kirchhoff et al. 2018; Slijepcevic 2024) and could be used to
describe any type of biological evolutionary phenomenon, including
morphological development (Kuchling et al. 2020), phylogenetic
evolution, psychology and even the evolution of societies and scientific
knowledge (Campbell 2016). In the case of phylogenetic evolution, for
example, the set of "instructions" for growth and development that an
organism inherits constitutes a kind of prediction about the organism's
suitability for its environment. It is as if a phenotype were actively
inferring the state of its ecosystemic niche under a generative model,
whose parameters are learned through natural selection, seen as the
optimization process of the Bayesian model (Friston et al. 2023; Czégel
et al. 2022).</p>
<p>This theory considers that living organisms and their various forms
are organized according to a generative computational model oriented
towards their maintenance and adaptation to the environment by the FEP.
It is mainly used in neuroscience to understand cognition's adaptive and
learning capacities (Friston, Kilner, and Harrison 2006).</p>
<h3
id="the-principle-of-free-energy-challenged-by-the-brain-under-psychedelics-3">1.2
The principle of free energy challenged by the brain under
psychedelics</h3>

<p>The FEP has been heavily discussed in the particular case of the
brain under the influence of psychedelics. This case is interesting
because it is challenging the FEP. The brain exhibits an increased
entropy, which seems beneficial for inducing biologically novel and
psychologically therapeutic changes. However, the FEP considers that
cognitive systems must constantly minimize their entropy relative to
their coupling to their environment, which correspond to « the long-term
average of surprise », defined as « the difference between an organism’s
predictions about its sensory inputs (embodied in its models of the
world) and the sensations it actually encounters. » (Friston et al.
2012). This principle apparently contradicts the phenomena observed
during the psychedelic experience. The theory of the entropic brain and
its new version, REBUS (RElaxed Beliefs Under
pSychedelics)(Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019), aims to overcome this
paradox.</p>
<p>Psychedelics, including LSD, psilocybin, DMT, mescaline and many
others, are natural or synthetic substances that act on the brain's
serotonin network, producing intense psychological and physiological
effects. Legal restrictions have limited their use in clinical research
for several decades. However, in recent years, these substances have
become the subject of active research, and numerous studies have
revealed the therapeutic potential of these molecules to treat a variety
of psychological problems, such as addiction (Zafar et al. 2023),
end-of-life anxiety (Whinkin et al. 2023), post-traumatic syndromes
(Fonseka and Woo 2023) and depression (Hristova and Pérez-Jover 2023;
Rivera-García and Cruz 2023). Although their molecular mechanisms of
action, through interaction with serotonin receptors, notably 5HT1A and
2A, are well known (Cameron et al. 2023), they are not sufficient to
explain their effect on the dynamic organization of the brain and
psyche, which requires a specific theoretical approach. The leading
theory today is that of J. Carhart Harris, known as REBUS
(Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019). It is based on the principle that
thanks to their entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity,
psychedelics act to relax the precision of high-level hierarchical
beliefs, freeing up activity at lower levels (note that this effect is
especially visible at high doses of psychedelics, and that lower doses
may induce the opposite effect, a strengthening of beliefs (Safron et
al. 2020)). This theory mobilizes the principle of free energy. As
mentioned above, the FEP describes brain behavior based on its inherent
tendency to resist disorder and minimize uncertainty by optimizing,
through Bayesian updating, its probabilistic representations and
sampling of its environment. These representations, or a priori beliefs,
constitute predictive processing organized in hierarchical levels
(Friston 2010).</p>
<p>In the Bayesian vision of the brain, bottom-up sensory input is
compared with inferred top-down predictions. The resulting prediction
error is then passed on to higher hierarchies to update the
representations, generating top-down predictions on lower levels
(Badcock et al. 2019). Following the FEP, Neural dynamics attempts to
minimize the amplitude of prediction errors at each hierarchy level.
This process provides an optimized causal explanation of sensory input
at several levels of hierarchical abstraction. The highest levels form
compressive synthesis from the content of the lower levels they envelop,
thus reducing their potential information content (Ruffini 2017).</p>
<p>The apex of this hierarchy of prior belief levels is instantiated by
the DMN, the "default mode network" (Margulies et al. 2016;
Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019) considered to be the seat of the sense
of self, of identity as "internal narrative" (Menon 2023). The DMN,
functionally positioned as far as possible from sensorimotor input
(Smallwood et al. 2021), is associated with subjective states such as
reflection, remembering, introspection, planning, social interaction,
abstract thought... (Buckner, Andrews-Hanna, and Schacter 2008; Menon
2023).</p>
<p>The theory's central idea is that psychedelics increase the entropy,
the variational free energy, of brain activity and reduce the precision
(inverse variance, felt confidence, rigidity) of higher-level prior
beliefs, making them more sensitive to bottom-up prediction errors. This
process would disrupt the DMN's directional function and relax prior
beliefs, making them more plastic and susceptible to change into new
configurations of meaning. Thus, at the psychological level, psychedelic
intake can temporarily induce a feeling of uncertainty but also
intuitive understandings and changes in perspective about oneself and
the world (Timmermann et al. 2021). At the biological level, we observe
that brain dynamics display increased complexity, the construction of
new and diverse connectivities is promoted (Carhart-Harris 2018), and
neurogenesis is stimulated (Calder and Hasler 2023).</p>
<p>In short, taking psychedelics in significant quantities
“disorganizes” the cerebral hierarchy temporarily and seems to induce
the creation of new configurations, sometimes functional at the
physiological level and meaningful at the psychological level. Why?</p>
<p>Although psychedelics appear to "temporarily breach the free energy
principle" (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019), the authors point to a
higher level at which free energy would be minimized, inducing a
revision of beliefs about generative models themselves. This process
would be achieved by selecting the best-performing model from a set of
models (Bayesian Model Selection) or reducing complexity (Bayesian Model
Reduction) by removing redundant model parameters. These mechanisms for
simplifying and generalizing the model would produce "inferences used to
fill an explanatory gap." This type of inference would underlie the
experience of insight (also called "eureka" moment or intuitive
understanding) (Friston et al. 2017) and explain the changes in point of
view generated by the psychedelic experience (Carhart-Harris and Friston
2019).</p>
<p>These mechanisms would also be responsible for recalibrating the
relevant beliefs to be better functionally harmonized with the other
levels. As the cause of many psychological illnesses is the pathological
weighting of certain prior beliefs, this process of recalibrating
beliefs could explain the therapeutic effect of psychedelics on mental
health over the long term (Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019).</p>
<p>On the informational level, the effect of psychedelics can be modeled
as a reduction of the curvature of the energetic landscape that contains
neuronal dynamics and a flattening of the local minima. This phenomenon
allows neuronal dynamics to escape its attractor's basins and prior
beliefs and explore the space of state with fewer constraints. The
authors consider this flattening of the energy landscape of the brain by
psychedelics as analogous to the method of annealing in computer
science, a method of optimization to find new local minima. Inspired by
metallurgy, this approach is performed in two steps. First, the system
is "heated". It reaches a state of increased plasticity to discover
"new" relatively stable low-energy states where the system can reside at
lower temperatures (Wang and Smith 1998). This method is also similar to
new approaches of complexity as emerging from transitions between an
order and a disorder phase (Paperin et al. 2011).</p>
<p>In short, at the level of the brain, this exploration of the state
space would correspond to a curious behavior of novelty exploration and
openness to surprise, seeming to go against the FEP. However, K Friston
and J Carhart Harris consider that this behavior, called "epistemic
research" or “epistemic foraging”, is induced by a learning objective,
i.e., this behavior is allowed by the a priori that there is something
to learn, a given expected uncertainty that must be reduced. Reducing
this last level of uncertainty, and therefore learning, means choosing a
policy that also maximizes the ability to predict through model
selection (BMS and BMR) that makes the results less surprising (Friston
et al. 2017; Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019). In this sense, a higher
level of FEP, in the longer term, would generate exploratory behavior in
the short term and be responsible for the experience of insight and
intuitive understanding, whether during a psychedelic experience or not.
Thus, in this perspective, the biological and human characteristics of
curiosity, intuition and meaningful insight, essential to creativity,
are always justified by the FEP.</p>
<p>The info-computational and cognitivist vision of life considers that
any biological system is a computational process guided by the FEP, a
principle of optimality oriented to preserving priors, homeostasis, and
organization maintenance. If the entropic disorganization of living
systems, by psychedelics in the case of the brain, allows the production
of novelty, such a phenomenon is allowed only by a higher level
following the FEP optimization.</p>
<p>However, we will see that the notions of information and optimization
have shortcomings in life sciences. The FEP is based on assumptions
(including the existence of a predefined phase space) that we think
needs to be revised to understand living beings.</p>

<h3
id="brief-philosophical-criticism-of-the-notion-of-information-3">2.1
Brief philosophical criticism of the notion of
information</h3>

<p>Information is at the core of many current technological
developments, and it is tempting to go beyond this dimension and to
think that the world is made of information and computations. Galileo
followed a similar path when he stated that “Philosophy [i.e., natural
philosophy] is written in this grand book — I mean the Universe — which
stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless
one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters
in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics
[...]”(Galilei 1623). Instead, we think that it is necessary to
distinguish our understanding from the things we aim to understand, that
is, to distinguish physics (and biology) from metaphysics. The question
we are addressing in this paper is theoretical: we seek to understand
the world with conceptual tools, not to find its ultimate nature. From
this perspective, the notions of information and computations are formal
tools and concepts, not natural essences.</p>
<p>The info-computational paradigm is essentially based on the notion of
Shannon information: in a given space of possibility, the possible
signals to be transmitted, the amount of information, i.e., the
informational richness, corresponds to the inverse of the probabilities
of occurrence of a signal, in this sense, the rare is more informative
than the frequent (Lesne 2014).</p>
<p>Boltzmann's entropy inspired this vision. However, Boltzmann's
entropy has a coefficient, Boltzmann constant, that refers to a specific
physical phenomenon requiring a physicomathematical interpretation,
including units (Castiglione et al. 2008). Confusing information and
entropy means forgetting this physical dimensionality. This misuse
entails that information would be everywhere since entropy is produced
wherever there is irreversible energy transformation. Brillouin’s use is
more interesting as it addresses information the experimenter can get
from a system. He defines information as negentropy, that is, with the
opposite sign w.r. to Shannon’s information, and he argues that any
measure that produces information requires a transformation of energy,
therefore increasing entropy (Brillouin 1956). Information is physical
in the sense that it requires physical transformations, but physics is
not information; we do not think information is intrinsic to matter or
that it has become a robust, fundamental concept of physics (Longo
2020). Notably, information is not associated with proper conservation
principles.</p>
<p>The invariants of action constituted by a cognitive system, the
belief structures from the perspective of the FEP, are the foundation of
the notion of information, which creates a progressive detachment from
the materiality of the phenomena that deepens with language, symbols,
and even more by writing. Thus, cognition creates information from the
contextual meaning, not vice versa. We distinguish information as the
elaboration or transmission of signs and information as the production
of meaning in active friction with reality.</p>
<p>In the informational approach, the production of meaning is the
production of information. However, this approach eliminates
intelligibility in favor of formal normativity by sets of instructions
that would govern the living or by local optimization. This approach
neglects the importance of interpretation and eliminates the biological
singularity that comes from the historical formation of meaning by
confusing salience and pregnancy. Salience has no meaningful depth; it
is only a flat correlation, a regularity detection. It corresponds to
what constitutes automatic learning algorithms, whose interpolative
power finds regularities even in pure randomness (Calude and Longo
2017). By contrast, pregnancy already possesses elements of meaning,
proto-semiotics embedded in the emotions and body (Sarti, Citti, and
Piotrowski 2022; Wildgen and Brandt 2010). In biology, pregnancy
typically ultimately affects survival and the ability to reproduce.</p>
<p>Thus, in our view, constructing a hierarchy of meaning is not
reducible to a formal question, to the results of computations
constituting saliences in an optimized way. On the contrary, it is
constituted by a practice of what is pregnant for the organism that acts
for a purpose; it forces hierarchies of meaning on this basis. The brain
is then a system of meaning production rather than information
processing (Longo et al. 2012).</p>

<h3 id="criticism-of-the-principle-of-optimality-3">2.2
Criticism of the principle of optimality</h3>

<p>The FEP can be understood as a physics of coupled systems (Ramstead
2023) and is based on two main physicalist assumptions, namely the
optimization principle, grounded on the a priori of a pre-given phase
space. There are relevant general criticisms that several authors have
addressed (Longo, Montévil, and Kauffman 2012; Montévil et al. 2016a;
Sarti, Citti, and Piotrowski 2019) included in (Colombo and Wright 2021;
Guénin-Carlut 2023; Nave 2025). Here are the main points.</p>
<p>The principles of optimization presuppose the existence of an optimum
locally or globally, in which case it serves as an attractor in the
phase space and is determined a priori. This kind of reasoning is
ubiquitous in physics to determine and predict dynamics. Even some
dissipative systems far from equilibrium (e.g., clouds, hurricanes, or
flames) are considered necessary and optimal geodesics in their phase
space. Their forms are generic and not the result of a creative process,
just like the configurations produced by algorithmic optimality methods.
Accordingly, they can be generated <em>de novo</em> in practice. The
phase space is predetermined, and all the possibilities are already
there.</p>
<p>Thus, the main dynamics taking place are perpetuated and
strengthened. The changes in configurations and the appearance of
novelties take place only as a search for an optimum. This approach
neglects the production of novelty in a strong sense, that is, involving
a change of what is possible (Longo, Montévil, and Kauffman 2012; Sarti,
Citti, and Piotrowski 2019; Montévil 2019). Simarly, assembly theory
aims to understand how novelty can appear as a combination of the
existing objects (Sharma et al. 2023). Thus, there is an opposition
between creativity and mathematical optimality. This creativity, at the
origin of the various survival strategies of an organism, does not
preexist; there is no optimal way to discover it. Conversely, if we
consider that the living produces new possibilities, optimization can
have a meaning but is limited in its scope. When there are enough
established and stable constraints to create a space with regular
consequences, optimality can appear as an adjustment, primarily
quantitative.</p>
<p>Let us unpack this concept of change of the possibility space. The
way to model a change in physics is primarily a change of position in a
predefined space, the state space. Some space changes exist, of course,
in physics, from statistical mechanics fluctuations in the number of
particles in the grand canonical ensemble to Fock’s spaces in quantum
mechanics; however, the condition for their use in modeling is that the
new dimensions are theoretically identical to the old ones so that a
single mathematical description can subsume them. By contrast, one of us
has argued that biology requires addressing changes in possibilities
that correspond more technically to situations whose organizational
outcomes are not generic consequences of the causes established
initially (Montévil 2019). In practice, it follows that what is possible
cannot be prestated – even though we can, of course, prestate some
possibilities. This theoretical situation is the hallmark of
historicity. The practical consequence is that the way to describe and
manipulate theoretical living organisms is markedly distinct from
physics, as exemplified by the names of systematics, which are defined
by their historical origin and not by invariants of the causal
determination (Montévil 2019). Without a proper account of this
practical and theoretical consideration, there is a gap between the
theoretical description and the empirical object of study.</p>
<p>The FEP also requires explicitly an assumption of ergodicity (Friston
2013), that has been criticized for biology (Longo, Montévil, and
Kauffman 2012). Ergodicity roughly means that the system will travel the
possible states in a uniform way; and it is required to connect the
microscopic and the macroscopic levels of description by means of
entropy. The question of ergodicity is another way to look at the
problem of predefined possibility spaces because ergodicity breaking
corresponds to change in macroscopic possibilities. </p>
<p>On the other hand, within the FEP formalism, the result of a
phenomenon depends on the path; one says pathway-dependent, a common
approach in physics. Physics aims precisely to study what is generic and
does not depend on context and history. In the case of pathway
dependence, the past is integrated into the present, but only what has
visible consequences on the path is taken into account. This approach
does not retain what does not leave a visible trace in the final result;
therefore, optimization levels down historicity. However, we understand
biology only if we know evolutionary history, the past can re-emerge
later in a contingent way and participate in generating new
configurations (see section 3).</p>
<p>Finally, the FEP needs to be revised in its relation to teleology.
Indeed, variational principles, such as the principle of least action,
can be interpreted teleologically, and this point is widely discussed
(Glick 2023). In physics, there are counter-arguments to this
teleological interpretation, but these counter-arguments are not
relevant to the FEP. In physics, this principle can be seen as emerging;
it is fundamental for FEP advocates. In physics, it corresponds to the
stationarity of the action, so an extremum without specifying which;
while it is a minimization for the FEP. Finally, the least action
principle is about a trajectory, while the FEP explicitly sets the
distal goal of a minimum of surprise. We do not think this assumption is
necessary to biology, as we will see in section 3.</p>
<p>Teleology raises different issues in physics and biology, and
completely rejecting it in the latter is unnecessary. However, the
teleology of the FEP considers a general purpose given by the FEP, which
is problematic and constitutes, in our view, a conceptual regression
concerning the historicity of the living coming from the theory of
evolution. If there must be a biological teleology, it is very relevant
to consider that living beings give themselves their own ends and that
the latter can change over time. This point is precisely the proposal
made by philosophers working with the closure of constraints: the
organization can be interpreted as teleological because it
self-determines through the circularity of the closure (Mossio and Bich
2017). The norms are then individual norms, which means that they can
change. Moreover, the way closure changes also becomes historical and is
not subsumed by an optimization principle.</p>

<h3 id="the-cost-of-optimality-3">2.3 The cost of
optimality</h3>
<p>According to the FEP, any living system is a nesting of Markov
blanket, where each blanket defines a statistical partitioning between
internal and external states. The internal generative model seeks to
represent the external environment best in order to optimize its
predictions and reduce the gap between what is perceived and what is
expected. Thus, what is selected and observed preferentially is driven
toward what can best validate the model's evidence and reduce its
uncertainty. This situation amounts to an exploitative research behavior
(Friston et al. 2017) consisting of being attracted only by what goes in
the direction of the priors and denying or not paying attention to what
is too distant from the expected, the things we do not know that we do
not know. This optimization leads the sensory input to be similar to the
output, thus the border between what is internal and external is
transformed gradually in the impermeable border between the expected and
the unexpected, i.e. the entropic alterity.</p>
<p>Moreover, more concrete actions on the world to reduce the
uncertainty of the model also tend to reduce the unexpected and thus the
possibility of learning genuinely new things. As a result, the priors
are becoming stronger and less tolerant of uncertainty. In other words,
the system becomes hyper-selective and only accepts what fits into the
model and tends to stiffen it. This phenomenon is adequate to explain
certain behaviors such as denial or confirmation bias, or even certain
pathologies (depression, anxiety) where the world model takes over
perceptions by conditioning them strongly (Badcock et al. 2017; McGovern
et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Thus, the FEP alone necessarily induces <em>self-referential
confinement</em>; Carhart Harris speaks of "conservation bias on
adaptation" (Carhart-Harris 2018). This confinement can be compensated
by a curious and exploratory behavior, requiring a certain acceptance of
uncertainty, or by taking psychedelics, the two joining since
psychedelics seem to encourage the exploratory behavior of the brain.
According to REBUS theory, the increase in cerebral entropy by
psychedelics "seems to breach the principle of free energy temporarily"
(Carhart-Harris and Friston 2019), which appears beneficial to mental
health and creativity (Mason et al. 2021). However, this breach is only
apparent according to them. The authors evoke a new, higher level of
application of the principle of free energy at the level of the models
themselves (Bayesian Model Reduction and Bayesian Model Selection).</p>
<p>Thus, optimizing a higher level could explain the violation of the
FEP at a certain level. The lower level, when it does not tend towards
the optimum, would have an exploratory role because of the higher level.
The latter would exercise the exploitative role necessary to speak of
minimizing free energy and being causally responsible for curiosity.
This induction of the local violation of the FEP would lead to new
intuitive understandings. The upper layer would be responsible for this
harmonious "recalibration" of beliefs, thanks to its operating FEP.
Thus, the famous balance between exploration and exploitation,
understanding and precision, or generalization and specification should
be found in the interaction between two optimization layers. </p>
<p>However, the exploitation expected by the upper level induces and
conditions the exploration of the lower level. The exploration is then
remotely guided by the projection of what is helpful to discover and
learn, which goes toward reducing uncertainty. This long-term
orientation toward the optimal limits exploration, curiosity and will
necessarily lead the system to shut itself from the unexpected.</p>
<p>Thus, a higher level of FEP does not, or only temporarily, counteract
optimization excesses at the lower level unless it has an even higher
level under the FEP and so on to infinity. These upper layers would be
devoid of a priori in the form of belief except the intrinsic a priori
of the FEP: a predetermined and, therefore, closed phase space and the
pre-existence of optima imposing a finality.</p>
<p>Finally, in the FEP theory, exploration is an emerging phenomenon
caused by its future optimality assumed by a higher level of FEP.
Exploration is not a principle. There is no gratuitous curiosity;
inferences act as motion-generating attractors, and the default state
(without attractor) is immobility and conservation. Adaptation
manifested as exploratory curiosity and learning, responds to a problem
or a threat to survival, whether present or projected in the future as a
priori. Necessity is the driving force of a transient contingency, just
as invariance is the driving force of movement.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, we will assume that exploration is a constituent of the
default state of biological organizations and is revealed by suspending
higher-level organizational constraints; therefore, the opening of a
level does not require optimization at another level, the opening is
constitutive. We propose to move from a computational Bayesian model to
a more parsimonious theory of specific objects and constraints where we
do not assume a general optimization principle.</p>

For a new biological theory: Biological organizations between opposite
entropic tendencies</h2>

<p>In the continuity of Darwin's first principle, reproduction with
variation, we elaborate a biology of the activity, motility, and changes
in possibility that constitute the historicity of the living. We
contribute to an alternative to the conservation and optimization
principles inspired by the theories of inert objects, whose first
assumption is the a priori definition of the phase space. Physics
explains change on the basis of invariance; in biology, change is
ubiquitous and we need to explain historicized invariances; see Montévil
and Mossio (2020). The relationships that constrain and enable the
organization and evolution of life constitutes our theoretical starting
point. In this section, we will analyze two aspects of entropy and use
this analysis and the subsequent concepts to discuss biological
situations where, we contend, entropy is not defined as a function in
general. </p>
<h3
id="two-opposite-but-complementary-entropic-trends-3">3.1 Two
opposite but complementary entropic trends</h3>

<p>1) Physicists generally speak of entropy increase when there is a
dispersion of energy. Entropy increase corresponds, at the local level,
to an increase in the number of equivalent microscopic states, thus a
form of randomness, and, at the global level, to homogenization. For
example, when particles of a gas are concentrated at a given location,
it tends towards a uniform distribution. The latter has a simpler
macroscopic description than the former – we do not need to specify the
location describing the heterogenous distribution –, and it corresponds
to far more microscopic configurations, because all particles have the
same chance to be anywhere. Entropy increase describes processes
directed in a single direction, the most generic one, which amounts to
tending towards a form of stability and predictability. In the structure
of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, entropy is used to specify
the final state of a system tending to equilibrium, as the one with
maximum entropy satisfying the constraints.</p>
<p>In a statistical physics system, in a sense, entropy and energy
functions compete because they have opposite signs and thus effects.
When the temperature is high, entropy, in the form of random agitation
of particles, dominates, for example, in a gas. When the temperature is
low, the energetic constraint dominates leading for example to a
crystal. However, in both cases the above discussion still applies and
entropy remains structuring. The system tends towards the most generic
macroscopic state given the internal constraints, energy in particular,
and the external constraints as the boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Then, local randomness gives stability at a larger scale; the
homogenization of the local variation then justifies stability. The two
trends described by entropy increase go together but they also have
opposite meaning – increase of the predictability at the global level,
and decrease at the local level, for example. While variation is
generally associated with disorder, homogenization and stability are
generally associated with "order." There is, therefore, a form of
"ordering" described by entropy increase at the global level, as
Schrödinger already envisaged in his notion of "order-from-disorder"
(Schrödinger 1944), where order simply means macroscopic
regularities.</p>
<p>2) We can find this double entropic trend in the FEP and its
application to the Bayesian brain. Indeed, the FEP assumes that any
living system, particularly the brain, follows a Bayesian generative
model of world representation that evolves by maximizing its evidence
and the validity of its representations, which amounts to minimizing its
relative entropy. Here, the local entropic trend is described by the
relative entropy, also called uncertainty, surprise, or prediction
error. The FEP is a variational principle, like the least action
principle and the maximum entropy principle, but applies to Bayesian
mechanics as "physics of and by beliefs" (Ramstead et al. 2023). The FEP
states that the generative belief model always evolves in the direction
of the most probable, ultimately tending to a stationary state of
maximum entropy that can be interpreted as the global entropic trend of
the system under the constraint of the a priori of the model and
external states. Thus, according to the FEP, living systems are
teleologically oriented models, following a physics of beliefs toward
their stability in their environments driven by the global entropic
trend. They oppose the dissipative local entropic trend which is also a
source of "information" on their environment. This modeling is organized
as nested Markov blankets where the global level operates to optimize,
notably simplifying and reducing the local level according to the regime
of constraints made of a priori beliefs.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we pointed out some limitations of this
vision. Firstly, the phase space is already predetermined, which means
that the exploration of new possibilities is limited. Secondly, the
process of optimization overrides historicity, which means that the
context and history of the object are not properly taken into account.
Finally, an exploration that is induced and determined by a higher layer
of optimization does not compensate for the self-referential
confinement. We propose an alternative perspective that shares some
similarities with the FEP approach but has fundamental differences.</p>
<p>3) We extend the definition of these two entropic trends by their
level of description. In physics, the global is derived mathematically
from the local by a state or path integral, with the assumption of
ergodicity. In biology, we introduce a concept of global entropic trend
that would not derive mathematically from the local entropic trend,
because we do not assume ergodicity and a fixed possibility space. Let
us insist that in biology we do not assume that the global entropic
trend corresponds to a state function; however, we import, in biology,
part of the conceptual role played by entropy in physics, specifically
in the tension between the local and global aspects of entropy. The aim
of this extension is to work out the articulation between local and
global, variations and stability.</p>
<p>We will present briefly our perspective on biological organization to
go further. The idea is not to give a fixed definition of biological
entities, which are always transient and historical, but to think about
the processes that give rise to their relative stability (Soto, Longo,
Miquel, et al. 2016). This involves considering their historicity and
defining the organization of constraints within the living, according to
a "closure of constraints" constituted historically and contextually
(Montévil et al. 2016a; Mossio, Montévil, and Longo 2016). This concept
of closure differs from the concepts of convection cells or catalytic
cycles. It also further specifies the autopoïesis of Maturana and
Varela, since the latter does not specify the theoretical entities that
are the subject of this self-production. The specificity of the closure
of constraint is to define constraint dependency where the recursion in
the constraint chain "folds and establishes a mutual dependence."
Constraints maintain and compensate collectively for their dissipation
through constrained processes (Montévil and Mossio 2015), generating and
regenerating their interdependencies and leading to processes that would
not occur without constraints. It is this mutual maintenance that enable
biological organizations to last over time and diversify, by contrast
with physical self-organization that is a spontenous self-organization
of flows. The relevance of a given constraint remains limited in time
and contingent; organization can change over time. Closure of constraint
implements the coordination of interactions and relationships within
living beings and with their environments. However, their environments
do not fully determine them, and they resist them in a certain way.
Thus, the network of constraints can collectively determine itself, that
is, it self-maintains by self-constraint (Moreno and Mossio 2015). This
framework also provides a concept of biological function (Mossio,
Saborido, and Moreno 2009).</p>
<p>Starting from this approach of organization, we define the global
entropic trend as the "attractive" tendency of closure of constraints to
shut itself from destabilizing influences and achieve a stationary
equilibrium, i.e., a state less and less likely to evolve, neither under
the influence of a (relatively small) external disturbance nor internal
local fluctuations. This change is, therefore, a trend towards the most
likely state related to the priors and the context. The constraint
regime formed up to now is simplified by maintaining its link in the
context and then, at the limit, maintaining itself identically. In this
slow and gradual evolution towards stability, local entropic trend,
fluctuations that can affect the closure of constraint, is minimized.
The evolution of the closure of constraint following this tendency tends
to behave as if it followed a trajectory in a state space co-determined
by the relationship between its historicity and the context. Thus, the
more a closure of constraints closes to the variation, the more the
phase space and probabilities are definable. No entropy function is
defined in the general associated case, but in this limit case, we may
consider an associated function that could be that of the FEP. This
limit case is also the reason we introduce the general terms of global
and local entropic trends in a situation where there is no general
corresponding state function.</p>
<p>Closure justifies at least in part the relative stability of the
constraints involved, and as such, it participates in global entropic
trend. However, once organized in closure, the global entropic trend
also reinforces stability by self-simplifying (Umerez and Mossio 2013).
This concept of global entropic trend can be used to talk about the
invariances observable in the living, the tendency to maintain,
reproduce, repeat, and homogenize. However, it is a trend and not a
state reached in the living because any closure of constraint that would
be too shut from the milieu becomes fragile, loses plasticity, and risks
destroying itself abruptly with no possibility of resilience, which is
encountered in <em><em>second-order disruptions</em></em> (Montévil
2022) (see section 3.3). Let us also insist that this tendency to shut
oneself differs from the thermodynamic sense of a closed system, an
organization being always open from the latter point of view. It
corresponds to the absence of change of organization by friction with
the environment. Thus, the tick described by Von Uexküll reduces his
world to a minimal number of relevant aspects and has mostly automatic
responses to these aspects (Jakob von Uexküll 1965).</p>
<p>Let us emphasize that the global entropic trend should be analyzed at
the level of the closure of constraints and that the latter always has a
global dimension. It constitutes a higher level of organization compared
to the constraints that constitute it, considered as local, multiple,
diverse, and can be affected by local entropic trends.</p>
<p>In biology, we posit that local entropic trends corresponds to any
variation affecting a closure of constraint that is not part of a
pre-established possibility described by this closure and compatible
with it. In this sense, the local entropic trend corresponds to
unpredictable variations with respect to the knowledge of the initial
situation (Longo, Montévil, and Kauffman 2012). The local entropic trend
is a source of closure of constraint's changes and manifests itself at
different scales, such as "infidelities of the milieu" (Canguilhem
2013); these can be external, i.e., environmental or internal: DNA
mutations, rare configurations and interactions of proteins (the
stereo-specificity of the macromolecules being only partial), the random
and asymmetric distribution of cellular components between two daughter
cells, allelic rearrangements during meiosis, the recombination of
ancestral phenotypes, new neural connections, neural spontaneous
activity…</p>
<p>By contrast, already functionalized randomness is not a genuine
contribution to the local entropic trend from the biological
perspective. For example, stochastic resonance is a situation where
adding randomness contributes to functionality by amplifying a signal by
adding noise. Similarly, most molecule movements in a cell directly
result from diffusion. In these examples, randomness does not
destabilize the initial organization, it contributes to it.</p>
<p>The global entropic trend corresponds to maintaining the system and
repeating at least some of its dynamics, allowing living organisms to
maintain homeostasis and regulate their internal functions. On the other
hand, local entropic trend leads to the divergence of the system and its
disorganization. Therefore, we argue that living organisms exist in a
tension between local and global entropic trends.</p>

<h3
id="anti-entropy-as-the-tension-between-global-and-local-entropic-trends-3">3.2
Anti-entropy as the tension between global and local entropic
trends</h3>

<p>In the living, global and local entropic trends are in tension
between homogenization by the global, that is to say, by the
organization at the larger scale, and heterogenization by the local,
where one canalizes the other. For example, the ecosystem can exert a
relatively stable environmental selection pressure relative to the life
of an organism; at the same time, each new organism brings its
contribution to variation, both in relation to other organisms of the
same species and in relation to its viability in its ecosystem. This
negative selective pressure is globally homogenizing; it stabilizes the
local entropic trend in specific functional configurations. Thus, there
is not a single optimal configuration, an organism stereotype, to select
but a set with a common characteristic to be sufficiently viable in
their ecosystemic context. This process of openness to variation and
homogenization by excluding the incompatible is found at every scale of
the living. This process creates the diversity of individualities and
types of individuality (organism, cell, ecosystem, species), appearing
homogeneous on a global scale but having an internal diversity that can
manifest itself in a different, unusual context.</p>
<p>However, this tension is not in equilibrium or search of equilibrium;
it is even less 'optimal' or 'perfect.' On the contrary, there is a
discrepancy, a non-identity of oppositions, and a certain "relaxation"
of constraints, which generates a continuously reorganized dynamic. This
consists in changes of symmetry in cascade linking different levels of
organization and allowing these levels of organization to exist. In our
view, organization is more than near-critical, as describe in (Safron et
al. 2022; Parerin et al. 2011), where organization emerges in “edge of
chaos” inter-regimes balancing between disordered and ordered dynamics,
in a pre-defined ‘’phase space’’ containing the trajectories of the
dynamic. Similarly, we argue that since the space of possibilities is
constantly transforming (which is incompatible with formal optimality),
we say that organizations are then in a state of extended critical
transition (Longo and Montévil 2011). </p>
<p>In this context, we consider that the production of anti-entropy,
that is to say the appearance of new functional possibilities, takes
place between two opposite tendencies: to approach global entropic
stability, a trend to "optimality," and to move away from it by local
variation. It maintains its imbalance, a sort of back and forth between
these two crucial but destructive tendencies in their limit case (see
section 3.3). Anti-entropy production would then be in the tension,
never resolved, between local and global entropic trends.</p>
<p>This tension is found between the tendency to conservation, identical
reproduction, and repetition by the stability of the global and the
"open-ended" evolution, the divergence by the variability of the local.
Each living system has a certain degree of stability for its
maintenance. However, it also requires variation to maintain its
internal diversity, which tends to disappear by homogenization (see
section 3.3). This idea is found in the concept of proliferation with
variation, driving evolution and ontogenesis (Soto, Longo, Miquel, et
al. 2016). Even if the part of essentially similar reproduction is
greater than the part that varies (some mutations in the case of
meiosis, asymmetric distribution of some constituents in the case of
mitosis), the combination of the two is necessary for life. In short,
maximum homogenization and variation are like two entropic "attractors"
but at different levels, respectively global and local.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the production of anti-entropy, as the
appearance of functional novelty by integrating variation into an
organization, still requires the local entropic trend in the form of
variation. Consider, for example, one of the major evolutionary
transitions: the formation of eukaryotic cells by the symbiosis of
bacteria and archaea, particularly the formation of mitochondria
(Martin, Garg, and Zimorski 2015). The invagination of a bacterium in an
archaeon, leading to the appearance of mitochondria, was a large
entropic disturbance for the host archaeon or even for both. Then, by
co-evolution, their relationship became symbiotic, a new viability
situation among many failures of this evolutionary 'accident.' This case
exemplifies diversity production through the entropic encounter of
distinct evolutionary paths (Longo, Montévil, and Kauffman 2012).</p>
<p>In general, of course, no variation is directly anti-entropic. Its
effect in time and space on the existing biological organization causes
successive symmetry changes, i.e., processes of disorganization
requiring reorganizations. Think again of cell division: the entropic
component of proteome distribution, of partial DNA repair, contributes
to the anti-entropic production of the new organization, generating
diversity. If the reorganizations make it possible to maintain this new
organization, the entropic variation was then transformed into a
functional anti-entropic novelty. It is then at the origin of
evolutionary diversity at different levels of biological organization.
However, it also contributes to tissue differentiation during
embryogenesis – through strong sensitivity to contour conditions
(pressures, biochemical flows, etc.). Thus, it is as if anti-entropy is
"nourished" by the local entropic trend<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Entropic variability, which generates "defects" compared to the norm of
a living system, is necessary for its evolution and, therefore, for
evolution in all its forms, including learning.</p>
<p>Note that the new organization is not necessarily more complex than
the one from which it comes; there is no teleology towards ever more
complexity. However, complexity may allow for the invention of new
ecosystemic niches, in which case it is more likely to survive (Cazzolla
Gatti et al. 2018).</p>

<h3
id="from-the-fep-to-the-anti-entropic-vision-of-life-3">3.3 From
the FEP to the anti-entropic vision of life</h3>

<p>Let us now emphasize the fundamental differences between what we
propose and FEP.</p>

<h4 id="the-toxicity-of-the-global-entropic-trend-7">The
toxicity of the global entropic trend:</h4>

<p>Although the global entropic trend is an essential component of life,
by limiting the local entropic trend, it also can have negative
consequences. This trend does not end at the maintenance of the closure
of constraints; it continues to strengthen by self-simplification of a
closure. This tendency, when extreme, can lead to harmful consequences
for living beings in two linked and mutually reinforcing ways: the
reduction of the richness of historicity and the closure to the
contingency of the real, understood as what resists, especially to
representations. The real is nevertheless a source of historicity and,
therefore, of anti-entropy production.</p>
<p>Indeed, reducing the entropy of the past, of the belief model itself
in the FEP language, amounts to erasing its details, i.e., its internal
diversity from history, by a semantic oversimplification. The excessive
loss of the memory traces of the contextual elements in which the
closures were built reduces the historical richness to a single
trajectory and generic behavior devoid of tensions. This consolidates
the oldest and most general traces by eliminating redundancies. The
object becomes more and more predefined by an optimized pattern, able to
predict in a fixed milieu and only open to the proximal, restricted
future.</p>
<p>This trend results in intense selective pressure on the integration
of the local variations. This closedness to the present diversity of
reality reduces the integration of the local variations and the depth of
integration. Thus, the global entropic trend tends to make the closure
of constraint necessary, structural, rigid, automatic and anhistorical.
It tends to abstract itself and become impermeable to the context by
building a space of possibilities closed and in contraction. This
phenomenon leads to a loss of function by loss of the frictional
relationship with the contingent complexity of the context, leading, in
short, to self-referential confinement.</p>
<p>In other words, we move from metastability to stability. The excess
of constraint by the higher scale and the submission of the lower scale
leads to eliminating its degrees of freedom supported by the various
redundancies. There is a leveling down of levels into a synchronic unit
exceedingly coherent with itself but detached from the real context and
its improbable contingency. Diversity is reduced and canalized into
hyper-specialization. These phenomena lead to a loss of the plastic
resilience of the organization, i.e., its ability to produce
anti-entropy by integrating local entropic variation. The result is a
reduction in the space of possibilities that can go as far as
second-order disruptions, that is, the loss or impairment of the ability
to produce functional novelty (Montévil 2022).</p>
<p>The FEP, when considered the only fundamental law, entails the
strengthening of a model by permanent research of validation of the
model's proofs, leading to self-referential confinement. Concerning
cognition, this is manifested by a rigidification of thoughts, which is
found in several psychopathologies (e.g., physiological aging,
end-of-life depression, Alzheimer's) where the activity of DMN is
strengthened (Cieri and Esposito 2018). Additional levels of FEP do not
eliminate these problems (see section 2.3).</p>
<p>The rigidification and the reinforcement of the closure of constraint
are limited by the local entropic trend, which tends to destabilize them
by bringing variation and making them evolve. This idea is common to FEP
and our approach. However, for us, the local entropic trend is not only
external or "accidental," i.e., due to the organization's instability.
Moreover, the living not only repels variation but also maintains an
open relationship with the "unprestatable" (Longo, Montévil, and
Kauffman 2012). Local entropic trend cannot be modeled by injecting an
amount of randomness into a model.</p>

<h4
id="organization-and-local-entropic-trend-7">Organization and
local entropic trend:</h4>

<p>Local entropic trend not only includes disturbances coming from
outside but also those of internal origin, i.e. brought by
<em>historicity</em>. In the latter case, it corresponds to traces of
history not fully functionalized to the system and can be reinterpreted
into new functionalities according to the context. The traces of the
past resist normalization; they constitute a form of internal diversity,
of alterity within the system itself. Memory then constitutes a reserve
of deviation and not only a united block conditioning the future towards
ever more optimality. We can refer to the exaptation of vestigial
structures as an example. A past structure reappears but not wholly; it
is reinterpreted according to context and may result in a new
organizational function (Rayner, Sturiale, and Bailey 2022). Let us
emphasize that its potentialities coming from traces of the past are not
like hidden possibilities whose properties are actualized. Their
reinterpretation in the present gives them a new biological meaning.
Thus, what matters to the organization at a given moment only partially
defines what it is for the next moment. The new organization cannot be
formalized from the previous one because of this incompleteness
resulting from historicity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we argue that living beings maintain a fundamental
openness to the local entropic trend that comes from the principle of
variation (Montévil et al. 2016a). This openness also appears in what
has been called <em>propulsive constraints</em> (Miquel and Hwang 2016;
Montévil and Mossio 2015; Montévil and Mossio 2020). Their role is to
actively open the system to variation, which goes against the FEP. For
example, we can cite all the constrained processes (more or less
dependent on the context) bringing novelty when generating a new
organism: in bacteria, the modulations of genetic mutations according to
the context, exchanges of genetic material; and in protozoa: crossing
over, random phenomena during sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Proponents of FEP could argue that evolution would have optimized its
propulsive constraints. There is probably some optimization, but it
occurs after the appearance of a novelty, including a second-order
evolution novelty (Tenaillon et al 2001), and does not explain its
emergence. It requires a first opening to alteration, a relaxation of
constraints not guided by a superior optimality.</p>
<p>These considerations lead us to discuss what activity and passivity
mean in the living.</p>

<h4 id="new-perspective-on-activity-and-passivity-7">New
perspective on activity and passivity</h4>

<p>From the perspective of the FEP, passivity is the reception of
sensory input from outside; activity is active inference in two forms:
transforming the environment or transforming the representation of the
environment to make it less surprising in the future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we propose that passivity corresponds to the
mechanical, predictable functioning already included in the
pre-established dynamics by the constraints of the organization. Thus,
the "active" inference, made by the automatic projection and
transformation of expectations according to the FEP, is then also
passivity in the sense that its dynamic is pre-established towards the
minimization of variation.</p>
<p>To explain this, let us return to FEP: it is not specific to the
living and is considered as a "physics of beliefs" (Ramstead et al.
2023). Just as in physics, objects are passive with respect to the laws
governing them; biological organization is passive with respect to the
law described by the FEP. When the organization complies with the FEP,
that is to say, when the closures of constraints constituting it are
simplified without functional innovation, the evolution takes place
"mechanically" within a space of possibilities predefined, thus in a
kind of passivity. The case of the physicist's "active matter", as
described in (Chvykov et al. 2021), corresponds to a statistical
mechanics where the particles are out of equilibrium, but it also
corresponds to passivity in our perspective because the particle follow
fixed rules. </p>
<p>On the contrary, there is activity when there is a change in the
organization in a strong sense. This implies an active opening to
variation followed by a reorganization on several scales. The
organization is actively involved in its transformation, outside a space
of predefined possibilities, by integrating the local entropic variation
that is not governed by a “law” (Tahar 2023).</p>

<h3
id="the-question-of-the-default-state-of-the-living-3">3.4 The
question of the default state of the living</h3>

<p>The question of the biological default state has been put forward by
(Sonnenschein and Soto 1999), notably by analogy with the principle of
inertia, a state at the basis of classical physics. Inertia is never
exactly observable, but it structures the theory. The theoretical
strategy is analogous for the default state in biology.</p>
<p>In the theoretical perspectives inspired by physics, the current
paradigm of the default state of living systems is self-preservation
(Bourgine and Stewart 2004), similarly a common assumption in biology is
that the default state of cells is quiescence (Montévil et al. 2016b).
Change appears as a means for maintenance; this hypothesis goes hand in
hand with the search for balance, stability, and optimality, imposing a
limit to the changes. For example, at the cellular level of
multicellular organisms, this default state would manifest as
quiescence, an inactive cell at rest waiting for a triggering
stimulus.</p>
<p>Soto and Sonnenshein initiated a reversal of perspective by assuming
that the default state of cells is proliferation and motility and not
quiescence. It follows that there is no need for stimulation for cells
to display this default state. Instead, quiescence requires an
explanation in the form of a cause (Soto, Longo, Montévil, et al.
2016).</p>
<p>In our approach, we suggest moving from the primacy of the
teleological principle of entropy minimization to the notion of
anti-entropy as a tension between local and global entropic trends.
According to this notion, living beings are not intended to reduce
entropy to the maximum but to maintain a degree of openness to feed on
it, that is, to functionalize it and transform themselves. Living beings
are not just fighting against the local entropic trend but, instead,
grow from it.</p>
<p>We go from a default state of least action, passivity, to a default
state of activity where the variation is not triggered in response to a
disturbance from the outside but is intrinsically present, canalized,
and more or less maintained. It is a state of exploration outside a
predefined phase space without reward and not constrained by a superior
organization. This exploration, requiring an intrinsic openness to
variation, takes place not only through genetic variability but also at
different levels of life; it appears as motility, mobility, or curiosity
not motivated by a goal.</p>
<p>This exploratory impulse, most of the time repressed and constrained,
does not stem from a superior commitment to optimization. Considering
this as a default state has consequences on causality: if we assume that
the activity is by default, then if it is not observed, it means that it
is constrained, and we have to make these constraints explicit.</p>

<h3
id="the-relationship-to-the-space-of-possibilities-3">3.5 The
relationship to the space of possibilities</h3>

<p>The principle of variation and the interplay between local and global
entropic trends that we have just presented underlies a space of
possibilities in continuous transformation by default and whose dynamics
are not pre-definable (Montévil et al. 2016a). This is a fundamental
difference between the living and inert, and also between biological and
algorithmic creativity.</p>
<p>In algorithmic combinatorics, the elements are defined, distinct, and
preexisting in a synchronic and complete co-presence. They are then
combined according to pre-established rules with more or less
randomness, which is itself predefined. The resulting "creativity"
amounts to actualizing a part of a space of possibilities that is
already defined, typically on the basis of a gigantic amount of
data.</p>
<p>In biological generativity, there can be a combinatorics of elements
and randomness. However, this process is diachronic because the
"elements" are, in reality, a tissue of relationship, a set of
constraints possessing a singular, meaningful historicity. They then
have the possibility of being destroyed, mixed, entangled by the local
entropic trend, and then "rewoven", allowing them to cross the barriers
of the probable and thus open the space of possibilities. Of course,
this view is a major epistemological challenge, which is why assembly
theory assumes generic properties for selection that remain hypothetical
and independent of the nature of the novelties appearing.</p>
<p>Let us take the example of a mutation on a DNA nucleotide. There
seems to be a defined combinatorics, so a determined phase space.
However, this space is not sufficient for the theoretical determination
of the object. Its functional consequences will depend on the
neighborhood of this nucleotide (if it is in a gene, if there are
several modes of reading the gene), the epigenetic structure (e.g.,
accessibility of the gene, localization in the nucleus), the cellular
context (e.g., cell type, cell neighborhood) and the context of the
organism and its environment. All these layers of organization and their
space of possibilities have a certain degree of determinism necessary to
maintain them. However, the entanglement between the different levels
opens the space of possibilities to the indeterminate, contributing to
its expansion.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-1">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The question of a theoretical framework to understand organisms is an
open debate. In this debate, one of us has contributed to developing
three theoretical principles: the principle of variation, the principle
of organization, and the default state (Soto, Longo, Miquel, et al.
2016). These principles are sufficiently robust to be foundational in
biology; nevertheless, they are also starting points, and much remains
to be elucidated, notably concerning how biological organizations
change.</p>
<p>In that regard, a parallel effort has been accomplished on the notion
of a Free Energy Principle (FEP) stemming from cognitive sciences and
based on an informational perspective. The FEP is a framework that
explains how a system and its "belief" model evolve through Bayesian
updating. This updating is guided by an optimization principle that
involves adjusting the statistics of the things to which they are
coupled. This info-computational approach provides a view of
self-organization where organisms are layers of abstract representation
that generate probabilistic decisions. These representations are created
empirically by detecting common patterns, followed by a succession of
reduction operations, leading to model changes. The temporal evolution
of a system is considered as a combination of a deterministic component
and a noise component, which must be minimized. Noise is considered a
source of novelty, as in the case of the entropic brain, where entropic
annealing is used to explore the phase space and update new
configurations.</p>
<p>From the general perspective of the theory of organisms, we have
argued that the FEP is not acceptable as is. It assumes a pre-given
possibility space, which is the condition of possibility of an
optimization principle. In contrast, the principle of variation posits
that biological possibilities change over time and rejects general
optimization principles. Moreover, the general informational perspective
of the FEP is problematic and has been heavily criticized by others.
Specifically, the FEP leads to systems that would strengthen their
models in the context of their coupling with their environment by
minimizing surprise and uncertainty. As a result, it struggles to
address putative beneficial situations where the brain entropy
increases, like in the model of the entropic brain under psychedelics.
For FEP proponents, the way out is to propose a schema of nested
optimization levels so that increased entropy at one level would be part
of optimization at another level. This way out is problematic, though,
since this higher level would also require a phase space and
regularities to optimize entropy. In any case, it remains incompatible
with the notion of changing phase space and historicity as we define it.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the perspective of the FEP can be analyzed by concepts
that we introduce here, namely the distinction between <em>global</em>
and <em>local entropic trends</em>. In physics, the local entropic trend
would be the tendency of the system towards the microscopic
fluctuations, while the global entropic trend would be the tendency of
the system towards the macrostate that is directly or indirectly
determined and stable by the second principle of thermodynamics, that is
to say, the most generic state. By generalizing these concepts in the
context of the theory of organisms, the local entropic trend corresponds
to changes that are not yet functionalized, irrespective of whether they
are of intrinsic or extrinsic origin. Global entropic trend corresponds
to a tendency toward homogenization provided by a given organization and
its coupling with its milieu. Then, the FEP considers only the global
entropic trend in a specific informational setting, while the theory of
organisms includes a principle of variation that, in the terms of this
article, posits the universality and ubiquity of the local entropic
trend.</p>
<p>In the theory of organisms, the global entropic trend partly
corresponds to the closure of constraints, understood as stabilizing
constraints and the corresponding processes. However, the notion of
global entropic trend is more general. It opens the perspective of the
tendency to simplify a closure, preserving and stabilizing its main
functions and couplings with its milieu, possibly by taking inspiration
from the FEP. Now, local entropic trend is, of course, related to the
principle of variation. However, the principle of variation is about
functional variation, while the local entropic trend is about variations
that may be functionalized. As such, for example, we have emphasized the
traces of the past that are not functional for a given organization, and
that would be leveled down by the global entropic trend, but that may
also enable new functions.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the core message of our work, in line with previous
discussions (Montévil and Mossio 2020; Longo and Montévil 2012), is that
biological organizations are not, and do not tend to, organizational
fixed points. Instead, they are between two opposite tendencies: the
global entropic trend of homogenization and the local entropic trend of
destabilization.</p>
<p>As a perspective, from the analysis of the two approaches mentioned,
FEP and organicist, we can conjecture that there are two modes of
biological evolution:</p>
<p> -Passive: exploring the space of possibilities already defined by a
set of constraints (previous belief, inclination, habitus). This mode of
development, governed by the FEP, advances cautiously and incrementally
by capitalizing on what already exists.</p>
<p> -Active: that is, creative in the strong sense. It involves the
change of the set of constraint by the local entropic variations and is
able to change the space of the possibilities. It is actively promoted
by the propulsive constraints.</p>
<p>The conjunction of these two modes of evolution creates relevant
organizational changes, i.e <em>anti-entropic</em> in that it induces a
<em>virtuous circle of viability by allowing both stability of the
organization and openness as a possibility of new changes</em>.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-consequences-for-cognition-3">What are the
consequences for cognition?</h3>

<p>According to the current consensus, the brain's default state (when
the DMN is activated) is linked to the ego as a medium of identity. This
autobiographical self, supported by all the memories (representations),
guarantees the stability of the sense of identity despite the perceptive
changes (Damasio 2000) by minimizing free energy (Carhart-Harris and
Friston 2010). It is, therefore, a state of constraint and
self-maintenance.</p>
<p>Our perspective leads us to consider a different default state for
the brain or, more generally, the cognition of living beings. In
contrast to the DMN, which focuses on self-preservation, it would be a
state of exploration activity and curiosity free from its constraints in
the form of belief. At the biological level, it would be a state where
neurons activate themselves and make spontaneous connections in a
contingent way, as it is the case for unconstrained cryptic ‘spontaneous
electrical low-frequency oscillations’ SELFO (Hanson 2021), and at the
psychological level, a state of creativity. This default state,
constrained and therefore repressed in everyday life, can possibly be
experienced, among others, through the experience of ego death reached
during psychedelic experiences or deep meditation. In this case,
psychedelics and meditative practice would not act as triggers of this
state but as a relaxation of constraints on this state, which
corresponds to Carhart-Harris's thesis and his hypothesis of the
entropic brain.</p>
<p>The question arises of the re-organization of constraints, which are
preserved, destroyed, or created; how do they change in a relevant way,
i.e., therapeutic? According to the FEP, these are the ones that
minimize uncertainty the most. According to our anti-entropy approach,
on the contrary, constraints are reorganized in order to generate a
greater capacity for openness to uncertainty. This openness can involve
the removal of the most restrictive constraints (beliefs related to
depression, for example) but, above all, a greater capacity for
acceptance of the contingency of oneself and the world, like in
stoicism. This capacity corresponds to an increased ability to generate
anti-entropy from local entropic variations. At the psychological level,
it can manifest as greater confidence in the becoming, which precisely
does not rest on beliefs because it comes before the constitution of
beliefs itself.</p>
<p>The lifting of blocking constraints can be learned through different
techniques, for example, meditation (Ho, Nakamura, and Swain 2020)
potentially complementary to the use of psychedelics. In a sense,
philosophy or even sciences are also methods and attitudes that require
such an openness. All these techniques of relaxation of constraints and
openness to contingency require double attention to the sensitivity and
suspension of judgment, a fundamental gesture in philosophy also called
«epoché» <span id="anchor"></span>(Guilielmo and Mudry 2021). This
voluntary and active work can be considered as a propulsive constraint,
since it is a question of organizing its disorganization in an
undirected way. Thus, perhaps one of the main lessons of these practices
is to realize that seeking to minimize uncertainty is a locking belief,
while it is liberating to accept it.</p>

the means implemented by life to protect itself" (stasis). However, this
