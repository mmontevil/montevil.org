<p class="indent">
  Lacking an operational theory to explain the organization and behavior of matter in unicellular and multicellular organisms hinders progress in biology. Such a theory should address life cycles from ontogenesis to death.  This
  theory would complement the theory of evolution that addresses phylogenesis, and would posit theoretical extensions to accepted physical principles and default states in order to grasp the living state of matter and define proper
  biological observables. Thus, we favor adopting the default state implicit in Darwin’s theory, namely, cell proliferation with variation plus motility, and a framing principle, namely, life phenomena manifest themselves as non-identical
  iterations of morphogenetic processes. From this perspective organisms become a consequence of the inherent variability generated by proliferation, motility and self-organization. Morphogenesis would then be the result of the default
  state plus physical constraints, like gravity, and those present in living organisms, like muscular tension.

<p class="indent">
  Biologists acknowledge a crisis in their midst: on the one hand, reams of data acquired from a reductionist perspective (for example, “transcriptomics”) do not provide the anticipated understanding of the subject matter of their
  interest. On the other hand, the application of mathematical modeling has not helped much either. This is due in part to the preponderance of “pragmatic systems biology,” a practice that emphasizes large-scale molecular interactions
  which is technology-driven and does not claim explicit theory commitments (O'Malley and Dupre 2005).
</p>
<div class="indent"><span class="T73">Fifty years ago the notions of program, information and signal borrowed from mathematical theories seemed to resolve the differences between physics and biology made explicit by Kant: teleology, now under the guise of a program,
became acceptable to reductionists who claimed that biology could be reduced to physics and chemistry
</span><span class="T73">(Jacob 1974)</span><span class="T73">. However, the notions of program, information and signal borrowed from the mathematical theories of information have been hindering progress in biology </span><span class="T74">(Longo</span><span class="T73"> et al. 2012a)</span><span class="T73">. These notions require searching for biological specificity at the molecular level which is not coherent with that of biomechanics, another </span><span class="T73">important contributor to phenotypes. Yet biomechanics became prominent in several biological fields including cancer research. Indeed, tumors are palpable, a fact obviously related to their being more rigid than the surrounding
normal tissue. Thus, technical know-how is being introduced together with new operational definitions which may not be coherent with the ones already in use
</span><span class="WW-Footnote_20_Reference123456"><span class="T73"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: In operationalism, scientific terms are defined by the experimental operations which determine their applicability. For example, epidermal growth factor is a misnomer because it does not induce proliferation. However, it induces cell spreading in one assay: when cells spread, the circumference of the colony is longer, and, as only the cells in the periphery proliferate, EGF in this assay seems to increase cell number. When given in vivo, it induces early eye opening, a process characterized by cell death. So, in one operational definition it increases cell number, in the other, it increases cell death."><a href="#ftn1" id="body_ftn1">1</a>

<div class="indent">
  <span class="T73">The above-referred practice contributes to the feeling that biological complexity is unfathomable and that generalizations and global concepts are unhelpful</span>
  <span class="WW-Footnote_20_Reference123456"><span class="T73"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: For example, some biologists believe that there are exceptions to every rule, and that there are no valid “principles”, “rules” or overarching concepts. "><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">2</a>
</span></span></span><span class="T73">. Thus, the theoretical bases underlying the experimental programs being pursued remain only implicit. Meanwhile, the explosion of data continues unabated having neither sound theoretical bases nor an adequate language to make sense
of them. While acknowledging the immense complexity of organisms, we dare to think that what Darwin achieved for evolution could eventually materialize for ontogenesis: this will be achieved through the elaboration of an appropriate
theoretical framework.</span>

<p class="indent">
  <span class="T28">At the beginning of the Scientific Revolution</span>, scientists thought that they had direct access to their outside world: God’s will was to make nature intelligible to creatures like us. The separation of science
  and religion <span class="T29">was a long and complex process</span>: Kant's philosophy and Darwin’s theory were  major contributors to this separation. Ever since, scientists acknowledge that they are inside the world they wish to
  observe and study. As a result of this realization, objectivity had to be constructed through scientific theories that would provide intelligibility principles to frame observations, experiments and explanations.
  <span class="T28">I</span>n<span class="T46"> </span>the 16th<span class="T46"> </span>and 17th centuries, physicists developed theories that provided an accurate description of phenomena of the inert. In this theory-rich context,
  scientists were aware that theories determine which are the proper observables while, conversely, the choice of observables was a major theoretical commitment. For example, the decision to investigate the relationship between pressure,
  volume and temperature well before considering the atomic structure of gases (XVII century, Boyle and Mariotte), allowed to develop a theory at that level of observability. Further work at the macroscopic level originated modern
  thermodynamics (TD) as yet another major achievement of the XIX century;<span class="T28"> </span>this was well before Boltzmann's unification with an atomistic perspective. Notwithstanding, atoms and molecules are proper observables in
  another physical theory, Quantum Mechanics (QM).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  When living entities die, they decompose into particles of inert matter, and in turn, living organisms assemble the same inert matter in novel ways. The emergence of these novelties requires suitable theoretical constructs (;Sa
  <span class="T7">çlioglu</span> et al. 2014)<span class="T28">(</span> Longo G and Montevil M 2014 Perspectives on Organisms: Biological Time, Symmetries and Singularities (Berlin: Springer)<span class="T70">.</span>
  <span class="T37">)</span> That is, besides the already acknowledged physical principles and default states, additional principles and theoretical requirements are needed to describe proper biological observables, such as phenotypes.
  These extensions of physical laws into biology must be compatible with physical theory about inert matter, i.e., organisms should not violate the laws of thermodynamics, gravity or the quantum properties of their component particles.
  Yet, these principles may not suffice to make the biological dynamics intelligible at the phenotypic level.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In biology, other than Darwin’s theory of evolution (1859), the creation of global theories has not been as successful as in physics <span class="T51">(Soto and Sonnenschein 2012)</span>. Among other subjects, Darwin’s theory on the
  origin of species addressed common descent, encompassed a long time-frame and provided an adequate explanation of phylogeny. The fundamental principles in Darwin’s theory are a) <span class="T7">descent</span>
  <span class="T8">with modification</span> and b) <span class="T8">natural selection</span>. However, biology has yet to produce a theory of organisms that would encompass ontogeny and life cycles, i.e., phenomena occurring on a
  time-scale going from conception to death (Elsasser 1987).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T80">Recently, several worthy contributions have been made in this area (Davies, Deacon, Newman Kupiec).  </span>
  <span class="T73">Approaches based exclusively on stochasticity and natural selection like the ontophylogenesis  theory </span><span class="T73">(Kupiec 2010)</span>
  <span class="T73">provide new perspectives; however, they are insufficient to frame a theory of organisms because the molecular events at the core of the ontophylogenesis theory are causally dependent on cell, tissue and organismal contexts and these
contexts are not addressed by this approach.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Since the 1970’s, the thermodynamics of dissipative systems provided an opportunity to examine the relevance of self-organizing physical systems to the understanding of the emergence of life, as exemplified by the pioneering work of
   Prigogine and his school (Nicolis and Prigogine 1977)<span class="T53">,</span><span class="T56"> </span> Kauffman (Kauffman 1993) and others. For instance, Cottrell elegantly highlighted the role of thermodynamics while
  stressing the need for a biological perspective that would bring to this analysis distinctive biological characteristics such as historicity and purposiveness (Cottrell 1979). Unfortunately, despite these promising beginnings, the
  development of a theory of organisms has been hindered by the misuse of metaphors borrowed from theories of information <span class="T7">(Longo</span> et al. 2012a). To remedy this situation, we are proposing instead explicit principles
  for the elaboration of a theory of organisms that would make such a theory robust, and open to change when challenged by empirical evidence.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T73">Our analysis purposefully refers to physics, not only because biological theory should not violate physical laws, but also because there is a tradition in organismal biology to use both the similarities and differences between these
disciplines to advance biological knowledge. For example, Helmholtz improved the understanding of both the physiology of nerve conduction and muscle metabolism while developing the principle of conservation of energy in physics
</span><span class="T73">(Lenoir 1982)</span>
  <span class="T73">. An additional example is the current wave of physicists and mathematicians entering the field of Systems Biology while carrying with them the theoretical framework of physics </span><span class="WW-Footnote_20_Reference123456"><span class="T73"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: However, applying existing physical theories directly to biology might be misleading. For example, in numerous studies the use of the concepts of energy and temperature stems from a fruitful mathematical analogy with statistical mechanics. However, the analog of temperature and energy in models of interacting birds in a flock is not and cannot be expressed in the proper physical units (Joules for energy and Kelvin for temperature); as a result, these applications lack a theoretical justification for this energy to be conservative which is a crucial invariant property for statistical physics. A specific example of why any scientific theory developed within a specific domain cannot be directly applied to another domain is given in Longo et al (Longo et al. 2012a) about the application of the concept of information in biology."><a href="#ftn3" id="body_ftn3">3</a>

<p class="indent">
  First, we will go over the fundamental role that symmetries and conservation principles play in physical theories, in particular by defining the default state. Then, we will discuss the appearance of new observables, which is related to
  the concept of emergence, and how these concepts relate to symmetries and conservation principles. We will then posit that biology is characterized by a relentless breaking of symmetries, and propose a theoretical bridge between physics
  and biology which we are calling extended criticality. Extended criticality provides the theoretical frame for a non-conservative default state. The latter entails an intrinsic source of variation, which is a necessary concept in
  evolutionary biology together with a principle of non-identical iteration of morphogenetic processes.
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="32-default-states-and-symmetries-in-physics">3.2 Default states and symmetries in physics</h4>
<div class="indent">
  <span class="T84">Since Galileo and Descartes, physicists made the </span><span class="T75">default state </span><span class="T84">of inert matter explicit: this is inertia, an instance of fundamental conservation laws</span>

  <span class="WW-Footnote_20_Reference123456"><span class="T84"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: In the context of Galilean relativity, speeds are arbitrary or relative, and entail a change in position; therefore, position cannot be conserved.

</span></span></span><span class="T84">. In short, a </span><span class="T75">default state</span>
  <span class="T84">is what happens when nothing is done to the object in question. Three centuries later, E. Noether’s theorems provided a deeper understanding for this default state by mathematically justifying </span><span class="T76">conservation properties</span><span class="T84"> of energy and momenta in terms of </span><span class="T76">symmetries</span><span class="T84"> in the state equations </span><span class="T84">(van Fraassen 1989)</span>
  <span class="T84">. Ever since, symmetries (and their breaking) acquired an even more fundamental role in physics (Table 1).We refer to the notion of “symmetries” in the broad sense given to it by modern physics: they are transformations preserving
the key observed invariants proposed by the intended theory. Typically, by Noether's theorems, in classical, relativistic and quantum physics, energy and momentum conservation properties, may be seen as invariants with respect to
time or space transformations or continuous translations, respectively. Yet, the practice of symmetries is as old as Archimedes' principles as exemplified by the lack of movement of a scale withe equal and symmetric weights on each
arm. Particle physicists may propose that for symmetry reasons a particle should exist,  for example the existence of anti-matter was proposed this way. Of course, a symmetry with respect to an axis on a plane is just a very
specific and simple case of transformation (a space rotation, for example) preserving the properties of the geometric structure under examination.</span>

<div class="indent"><span class="T84">The “unconstrained” condition proper to the biological default state requires adequate physical conditions, such as specific intervals of temperature, pressure and pH. Sufficient nutrients provide a flow of energy and matter
canalized through metabolic processes. In these unrestrained, limit conditions, cells constitutively exert their default state, i.e.
</span><span class="T75">proliferation with variation</span><span class="T84"> plus </span><span class="T75">motility </span><span class="T84">(Table 1). The default state should not be conflated with conditions necessary for life. For example, metabolism is necessary for cells to be alive given that metabolism happens regardless of whether cells are proliferating or
quiescent, moving or immobile (“metabolism happens, whatever happens”).
</span><span class="T73"></span><span class="T84">In contrast, a default state is what happens when nothing is done to the object or system (“a default state happens when nothing happens to prevent it”). Consequently, the nature of what can be done to the system is defined by the
theory, like the concept of force in classical mechanics; according to Newton's first law force modifies (accelerates) inertial movement. Thus, the analysis of the constraints to proliferation with variation and motility is
fundamental to the intelligibility of organismal biology. This is equivalent to the role of Newton's laws for understanding mechanics. It should be remembered that Newton posed his laws “axiomatically,” as core principles of his
theory.

grounded on theoretic symmetries. In contrast, a cell or an organism will spontaneously move by using forces and flows of energy and matter. Cells do not require external stimuli to move. Movement along a direction represents a
symmetry change, and corresponds to a non-conservation property as it is not inertial. Moreover, these actions are accompanied by critical transitions

<p class="indent"><span class="T52">During early development, increases in the size of an organism occur by generation of new cells and production of extracellular matrix. Cell proliferation is the result of the default state and is constrained. Organ shape is a
result of the cells’ default state plus physical constraints, like gravity, and those ones created by the living organism, like muscular tension.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="T89">Inert matter requires causes to change states or properties. The causal structure of a physical process is determined mathematically by a set of equations justified by symmetries, such as equilibria. For example, Newton’s equations
relate forces to their effects, i.e., as causes of acceleration at equilibrium
</span><span class="T89">. In physics, causes and constraints on the default state are synonymous. Organisms, instead, are agentive and thus capable of initiating activity by themselves. The default state is a cause in biology; by contrast, anything that
affects the default state is a constraint. For example, gravity becomes a constraint for evolution and embryogenesis, and not a cause of biological dynamics.
</span><span class="T67">Gravity influences numerous if not all biological processes and it is a main determinant of morphogenesis as exemplified in the formation of the anteroposterior axis in chick embryos. However, the formation of this axis is not a
consequence of gravitation, but of the activity of cells under the constraint of gravitation: in our theoretical frame and language, gravity is a constraint and not a cause. 
</span><span class="T89">In sum, biological dynamics is grounded in the default state, that is, </span><span class="T79">proliferation</span><span class="T89"> </span><span class="T79">with variation</span><span class="T89"> and </span><span class="T79">motility</span><span class="T89"></span></p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T52">Constraints narrow down the range of “possibles”. For example, fibroblasts removed from subcutaneous tissues of an animal have the same size when dissociated and explanted into a culture dish. Soon after, their size varies over a
wide range
</span><span class="T52">(Rubin 1988;Rubin and Hatie 1968)</span>
  <span class="T52">. Constraints also enable other “possibles.” The bottom of a cell culture dish prevents displacement in that direction reducing the possible movements, but at the same time this constraint enables cells to crawl along a plastic
surface. In a multicellular organism, other constraints to the default state are relevant. Mechanical constraints limit proliferation, variation and motility, like when cells compress each other; they adhere to other cells, and
stretch each other. Fibers in the extracellular matrix apply tensile forces on structures allowing movement in certain directions and constraining it in others

</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T38">In contrast to physics where conservation principles frame the theories, in biology, the default state of </span><span class="T9">proliferation with variation</span><span class="T38"> is a </span><span class="T9">non-conservation</span><span class="T38"> principle </span><span class="T9">(Longo</span><span class="T38"> et al. 2012b;Longo and Montevil 2013)</span>

<p class="indent">
  <span class="T38">Finally, the recent phylogenetic history of every cell is the proliferation of its parental cell. On a far longer temporal scale unicellular ancestors of cells of multicellular organisms are assumed to have had </span><span class="T9">proliferation</span><span class="T38"> as their default state. Thus, it is the shift from </span><span class="T9">proliferation with variation </span><span class="T38">and</span><span class="T9"> motility </span><span class="T38">to</span><span class="T9"> quiescence</span>
  <span class="T38">, which should be explained, instead of being assumed. Cell proliferation is achieved by the execution of a cell cycle process, which does not stop until two quite similar but non-identical cells are formed. The cell cycle is a
representation of enzymatic reactions and physical processes leading to the duplication of the cell components including DNA, and the faithful separation of two daughter cells. Textbooks use the metaphor of the cycle operating like
a dishwasher performing a series of stereotyped tasks
</span><span class="T38">(</span><span class="T9">Alberts</span><span class="T38"> et al. 1994)</span>
  <span class="T38">. If quiescence were its default state, it would be difficult to activate the “cell cycle machine” by organizing the cell cycle components which entail a very complex network of constraints. Instead, when proliferation is the
default state, it becomes easier to prevent complex machinery from functioning: a simple mechanical or chemical constraint may suffice. For example, a switch will do it for an engine and an inhibitor will do it for a cell. To sum
the situation up, the difference between
</span><span class="T9">proliferation </span><span class="T38">or </span><span class="T9">quiescence</span>
  <span class="T38">as a default state corresponds to the difference between preventing something complex from happening and causing it to happen.  The latter is much harder to conceive, explain and realize.</span>

these means we go beyond properties that could be purely physical since autopoiesis would be enriched by biological variability and historicity, both associated with symmetry changes.</span>

Organization became associated with the meaning of organized living beings in the 18th century. In our narrative, organization is compatible with the notion of “organizational closure”. The later is a “distinct level of causation, operating in addition to physical laws, generated by the action of material structures acting as constraints” (Mossio and Moreno 2010). "><a href="#ftn19" id="body_ftn19">17</a>
</span></span></span><span class="T84"> and complexity are considered synonyms. However, while complexity is mostly meant to span the material world, including inert and living matter, organization should be viewed as an exclusive attribute of life and of machines
invented by humans. Complexity and organization ought to be explicitly defined and distinguished. We posit that phenotypic complexity is a quantifiable characteristic of static structures as exemplified by the anatomy of an
organism. Complexity can be quantified by enumerating its components such as the number of cell types, tissues, organs, organ-connected components, connections and nodes within networks, fractal dimensions of cells and organs, etc.
</span><span class="T84">(Bailly and Longo 2009;B</span><span class="T75">izzarri</span><span class="T84"> et al. 2011;Longo and Montevil 2014)</span>
  <span class="T84">. From the perspective of the framing principle, instead, organization</span><span class="T55"> </span><span class="T84">refers to a dynamic state of interdependence of levels that includes both structures and functions as well as integration and regulation. Organization cannot happen without complexity, but organization is not reducible to
complexity.</span>
</div>
<div class="indent">
  <span class="T84">Carcinogenesis illustrates how complexity and organization are not equivalent. For instance, in the mammary gland, precancerous lesions like ductal carcinoma </span><span class="T75">in situ</span>
  <span class="T84">are more complex than normal ducts. This lesion appears as a partial occlusion of ducts which results in more than a single lumen. Multiple lumena indicate higher measurable topological complexity (Figure 4). </span><span class="T84">Moreover, the epithelium-stroma interface has a higher fractal dimension than that of their normal counterparts </span><span class="T84">(B</span><span class="T75">izzarri</span><span class="T84"> et al. 2011)</span>
  <span class="WW-Footnote_20_Reference123456"><span class="T84"></span></span><span class="WW-Footnote_20_Reference123456"><span class="T84"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: “Cells within a cancer” is not synonymous with “cancer cells”.

</span></span></span><span class="T84">. However, a cancerous tissue is less organized in the sense that it does not adequately perform the function of the normal tissue of origin. For example, a blocked duct interferes with excretory function. Additionally, cells within
cancer tissues may not perform the functions of the cells within the normal tissue of origin. This combination of higher complexity and lower organization represents a true hallmark of cancer. </span>

<h3 class="sectionHead"  id="5implications-for-biological-research"><span class="WW8Num3z0" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0, 635cm">5.</span>Implications for biological research</h3>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T28">What are the benefits of adopting the principles for a theory of organisms delineated above? First, the proposed principles would help to move away from operational definitions. From the notion of gene to that of growth factor, the
use of operational definitions has resulted in contradictions and ambiguities that hinder the establishment of general and stable concepts
</span><span class="T28">(Moss 2003;Sonnenschein and Soto 1999)</span>
  <span class="T28">. Additionally, the proposed principles enable alternative explanations to the mechanistic ones inherent to the molecular biology revolution. The latter do not represent an explicit theoretical frame, but mostly refer metaphorically
to common sense notions, such as “information” and “program”., The use of these metaphors  forces explanations to be molecular and to follow predictable causal chains
</span><span class="T33">(Longo</span><span class="T28"> et al. 2012a)</span>
  <span class="T28">. Instead, by insisting on the search of constraints to the default state, multilevel biomechanical and bioelectrical explanations become as legitimate as molecular ones.</span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T28">Second, our principles radically change both observables and determination vis a vis the theoretical frames proposed by physical theories. Such a change enables us to anchor reasoning and modelization on robust biological
principles. Indeed, as implied by Turing, there is an epistemological gap between modelization and imitation
</span><span class="T28">(Turing 1950;Turing 1952)</span><span class="T28">. While the former is based on a theory concerning the object of knowledge, the latter is not. For example, </span>individuation becomes the result of non-identical
  morphogenetic iterations. This principle excludes a Platonic conception of ideal- or perfect organs or structures which would be determined as an optimal solution of an equation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Third, the principles we propose enable the construction and discussion of mathematical models on the bases of biologically relevant assumptions. For example, in ecology the commonly used equations addressing population size are not
  theory-based. Taking into consideration the default state and the notion of constraint it is feasible to obtain theoretically meaningful equations in which the food term is not a cause per se: this constraint becomes relevant only when
  there is scarcity of food. In an ecological context there are numerous parameters that enable the population to grow in number, however, those parameters actually play a role on growth (i.e., the growth rate) only when they are limiting
  the increase of the population. Food superabundance will not make the population grow faster.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T28">Fourth, we are proposing an alternative to the use of the notions of program, information, and signal specificity in biology. In particular, biological variation is not noise as in those information-based theories
</span><span class="T28">(Huang 2009)</span><span class="T28">. Rather than as </span><span class="T33">a priori</span>
  <span class="T28">determination as presupposed by the notion of developmental program, the two proposed principles lead to a conception of biological specificity that is defined directly with respect to the trajectory of organisms and their cells in
time and space as a cascade of symmetry changes.</span>
</p>
<h3 class="sectionHead"  id="6conclusions"><span class="WW8Num3z0" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0, 635cm">6.</span>Conclusions<span class="odfLiEnd"></span></h3>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="T28">Research on organismal biology is being conducted in the absence of a global theory. Instead, its conceptual framework is loosely based on the mathematical theories of information and on operational definitions. This combination of
notions has generated contradictions and hindered progress. In spite of a few successful outcomes, the application of physical principles without proper analysis of the differences between biological and physical situations has also
contributed to the current crisis. O
</span>ur <span class="T28">analysis</span> <span class="T28">of the differences between the physics of inanimate and living matter provides a sound perspective for the construction </span>of a much needed theory of organisms
  <span class="T28">while providing founding principles adequate for framing experiments and mathematical modeling</span>.

  applicability. For example, epidermal growth factor is a misnomer because it does not induce proliferation. However, it induces cell spreading in one assay: when cells spread, the circumference of the colony is longer, and, as only the
  cells in the periphery proliferate, EGF in this assay seems to increase cell number.  When given in vivo, it induces early eye opening, a process characterized by cell death.  So, in one operational definition it increases
  cell number, in the other, it increases cell death.

  <span>This situation is very different from the physical notion which involves a single point and a single symmetry change. At the mathematical limit, this may be viewed as a dense set of critical transitions in the intended interval

  with respect to the duration of the process being constrained, ii) a constraint changes the process being constrained  (<span class="T70">Montevil and Mossio)</span>.  Additionally, like for the mechanical default state
  (inertia) a constraint acts on the biological default state. In biological systems, constraints  enable the emergence of new processes and phenomena.

  “organ,” the musical instrument. Organization became associated with the meaning of organized living beings in the 18th century. In our narrative, organization is compatible with the notion of “organizational closure”. The later is a
  “distinct level of causation, operating in addition to physical laws, generated by the action of material structures acting as constraints” (Mossio and Moreno 2010).
