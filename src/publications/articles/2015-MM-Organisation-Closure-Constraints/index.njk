<p class="indent">
   We propose a conceptual and formal characterisation of biological   organisation as a closure of constraints. We first establish a distinction 
   between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes,   which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in non-equilibrium 
   open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which,   while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation 
   (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological   systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that 
   they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With   this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure 
   can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between   interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original 
   conception of the relationship between stability and variation which   emerges from this framework.

<p class="noindent">
  In Theoretical Biology, an enduring tradition has placed heavy emphasis on the idea that biological systems realise what could be referred to as “self-determination”. That is, in very general terms, the capacity of a system’s
  constitutive organisation to contribute to the determination and maintenance of its own conditions of existence through the effects of its activity (see also <a href="#XMossio2014">Mossio &amp; Bich</a> (
  <a href="#XMossio2014">2014</a>), for more details). Usually (<a href="#Xweber2002">Weber &amp; Varela</a>, <a href="#Xweber2002">2002</a>), the origin of this tradition is traced back to the characterisation of biological systems
  as “self-organising”, as Kant proposed in his <span class="cmti-10">Critique of Judgement </span>(<a href="#XKantCritique">Kant</a>, <a href="#XKantCritique">1790</a>). Over the last two centuries a number of authors, more or
  less explicitly inspired by Kant, have been proposing conceptual and theoretical accounts aimed at understanding the principles underlying biological self-determination.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Following Claude Bernard’s seminal work (<a href="#Xbernard1865introduction">Bernard</a>, <a href="#Xbernard1865introduction">1865</a>, <a href="#Xbernard1878leccons">1878</a>), during the first half of the 20th century
  self-determination was initially investigated as <span class="cmti-10">homeostasis </span>(<a href="#Xcannon1929vob">Cannon</a>, <a href="#Xcannon1929vob">1929</a>) and mathematically expressed in terms of feedback loops by
  first-order Cybernetics (<a href="#XWie48">Wiener</a>, <a href="#XWie48">1948</a>; <a href="#Xashby1956introduction">Ashby et al.</a>, <a href="#Xashby1956introduction">1956</a>). Homeostasis, however, is a general
  systemic capacity, exhibited by both biological organisms and some artefacts (as the classical example of the thermostat shows). Accordingly, recent contributions have aimed at going beyond the limitations of the notion of homeostasis
  in order to better capture the <span class="cmti-10">specificities </span>of biological self-determination. In this respect, relevant contributions were made during the 1960s by embryology (
  <a href="#Xweiss1968dynamics">Weiss</a>, <a href="#Xweiss1968dynamics">1968</a>). Waddington, in particular, suggested that in the biological domain homeostasis should be interpreted as
  <span class="cmti-10">homeorhesis </span>(stability of dynamics rather than stability of states), insofar as in biological systems what “is being held constant is not a single parameter but is a time-extended course of change, that is
  to say, a trajectory” (<a href="#XWaddingtonProlegomena">Waddington</a>, <a href="#XWaddingtonProlegomena">1968</a>, p.12).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A crucial step in the theoretical elaboration of biological self-determination is the account put forward by Piaget (<a href="#Xpiaget1967biologie">Piaget</a>, <a href="#Xpiaget1967biologie">1967</a>), whose core idea is to
  integrate in a single coherent picture two inherent dimensions of biological systems: thermodynamic openness and organisational closure. On the one hand, biological systems are, as von Bertalanffy (
  <a href="#Xvon1949biologische">von Bertalanffy</a>, <a href="#Xvon1949biologische">1952</a>) had already emphasised, thermodynamically open (dissipative) systems, traversed by a continuous flow of matter and energy; yet on the
  other, they realise <span class="cmti-10">closure</span>, which refers to mutual dependence between a set of constituents which could not exist in isolation, and which maintain each other through their interactions. In Piaget’s view,
  biological self-determination is specifically related to closure which, through the association between division of labour and mutual dependence that it implies, captures a fundamental aspect of the idea of “organisation” as such. In a
  word, biological systems self-determine because they are organised, and they are organised because they realise closure.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The centrality of organisational closure and its connection to organisation, as well as its distinction from (and complementarity to) thermodynamic openness, have become givens in most subsequent accounts of biological
  self-determination (<a href="#XLetelier2011100">Letelier et al.</a>, <a href="#XLetelier2011100">2011</a>). One of the best known formulations is the one centred on the concept of <span class="cmti-10">autopoiesis </span>(
  <a href="#XVarela1974187">Varela et al.</a>, <a href="#XVarela1974187">1974</a>; <a href="#Xvarela1979principles">Varela</a>, <a href="#Xvarela1979principles">1979</a>) which, among other aspects, emphasises on the
  generative dimension of closure: biological systems self-determine in the specific sense that they “make themselves” (auto-poiein). Precisely because of their dissipative nature, the components of biological systems are maintained only
  insofar as they maintain and stabilise not just some internal states or trajectories, but the <span class="cmti-10">autopoietic system itself </span>, as an organised unity<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-1001f1">[1]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In spite of its qualities, however, the concept of autopoiesis (and related computational models, see <a href="#Xmcmullin2004thirty">McMullin</a> (<a href="#Xmcmullin2004thirty">2004</a>)) suffers in our view from a central
  weakness, insofar as it does not provide a sufficiently explicit characterisation of closure. Biological systems are at the same time both thermodynamically open and organisationally closed, but no details are given regarding how the
  two dimensions are interrelated, how closure is actually realised, what constituents are involved, and at what level of description. In the absence of such specifications, as already highlighted by previous critical interpretations of
  the autopoietic theory (see in particular <a href="#XFleischaker198837">Fleischaker</a> (<a href="#XFleischaker198837">1988</a>); <a href="#XRuiz-Mirazo">Ruiz-Mirazo &amp; Moreno</a> (<a href="#XRuiz-Mirazo">2004</a>)),
  it remains unclear in what precise sense closure would constitute a causal regime which distinctively characterises biological organisation and its capacity for self-determination. In particular, closure might be generically understood
  as a causal regime involving some sort of circularity, fundamentally no different from the numerous examples of circular chains of transformations, that frequently occur in the natural (although not necessarily biological) world. Is
  there some <span class="cmti-10">principled</span> difference between biological closure and all other kinds of causal cycles ?
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A concerted attempt to answer this question has been made by Robert Rosen, who has explicitly claimed that a sound understanding of biological organisation should account for the distinction between closure and openness
  <span class="cmti-10">in terms of a distinction between two causal regimes</span>. In Life Itself (<a href="#Xrosen2005">Rosen</a>, <a href="#Xrosen2005">1991</a>), Rosen’s account of closure is based on a reinterpretation of the
  Aristotelian categories of causality and, in particular, on the distinction between efficient cause and material cause. Let us consider an abstract mapping
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>f</mi>
  </math> between the sets
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>A</mi>
  </math> and
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>B</mi>
  </math>, so that
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>f</mi>
    <mo class="MathClass-punc">:</mo>
    <mi>A</mi>
    <mo class="MathClass-rel">↠</mo>
    <mi>B</mi>
  </math>. If we interpret the mapping in causal terms, and look for the
  causes of
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>B</mi>
  </math>, Rosen claims (and develops a detailed conceptual and formal justification, that we will not repeat here) that
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>A</mi>
  </math> is the material cause of
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>B</mi>
  </math>, while
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>f</mi>
  </math> is the efficient cause. By relying on this distinction, Rosen’s central thesis is that: “a material system is an organism [a living system] if, and only
  if, it is closed to efficient causation” (<a href="#Xrosen2005">Rosen</a>, <a href="#Xrosen2005">1991</a>, p. 244). In turn, a natural system is closed to efficient causation if, and only if, all components having the status of
  efficient causes within the system are materially produced by the system itself.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  An analysis of Rosen’s account in all its richness would by far exceed the scope and limits of this paper. Let us just mention that, recently, several studies have made substantial contributions to re-examining, interpreting and
  developing Rosen’s ideas (<a href="#Xcb2010">Piedrafita et al.</a>, <a href="#Xcb2010">2010</a>; <a href="#XLetelier2003261">Letelier et al.</a>, <a href="#XLetelier2003261">2003</a>, 
  <a href="#XLetelier2006949">2006</a>; <a href="#XWolkenhauer2007461">Wolkenhauer &amp; Hofmeyr</a>, <a href="#XWolkenhauer2007461">2007</a>). What matters for our present purposes is that closure, and therefore
  self-determination, is located at the level of efficient causes: what constitutes the organisation is the set of efficient causes subject to closure, and its maintenance (and stability) is the maintenance of the closed network of
  efficient causes.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In this paper, we develop an account of organisational closure which is directly inspired by and, we believe, consistent with the theoretical framework established by Rosen. Nevertheless, although Rosen made clear progress in the
  understanding of biological organisation with respect to previous formulations, we believe that his characterisation of closure is not fully satisfactory. The main limitation is that it remains too abstract, and therefore hardly
  applicable as a guiding principle for biological theorising, modelling and experimentation. Closure is defined by Rosen as involving efficient causes but, without additional specifications, it might be difficult to identify efficient
  causes in the system: what entities actually play the role of efficient causes in a biological system? How should the relevant level of causation at which self-determination occurs be characterised?
</p>
<p class="indent">
  To deal with this issue, decisive insights have emerged from more recent literature which emphasise, in line with Piaget’s initial view, the “thermodynamic grounding” of biological systems (
  <a href="#Xbickhard2000autonomy">Bickhard</a>, <a href="#Xbickhard2000autonomy">2000</a>; <a href="#Xchristensen2000autonomy">Christensen &amp; Hooker</a>, <a href="#Xchristensen2000autonomy">2000</a>; 
  <a href="#XBergareche199945">Moreno &amp; Ruiz-Mirazo</a>, <a href="#XBergareche199945">1999</a>). In particular, Stuart Kauffman (<a href="#Xkauffman2002investigations">Kauffman</a>, 
  <a href="#Xkauffman2002investigations">2002</a>) suggests retrieving the classic idea of “work cycle” (in the sense of the Carnot engine), and applying it within the context of self-maintaining biochemical reactions. Based on Atkins’s
  ideas about work, conceived as a “constrained release of energy” (<a href="#Xatkins1984second">Atkins</a>, <a href="#Xatkins1984second">1984</a>), Kauffman argues that a circular relationship between work and constraints must be
  established in a system in order to achieve self-determination, in the form of a “work-constraint (W-C) cycle”. When a (W-C) cycle is realised, constraints which apply to the system are not independently given (as in the Carnot engine)
  but rather are produced and maintained by the system itself. Hence, the system needs to use the work generated by the constraints in order to generate those very constraints, by establishing a mutual relationship, i.e. a cycle, between
  constraints and work.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In a fundamental sense, the account of closure that we provide in this paper lies at the intersection between Rosen’s and Kauffman’s proposals. In particular, our central thesis is that organisational closure should be understood as
  <span class="cmti-10">closure of constraints</span>, a regime of causation which is at the same time distinct from - and related to - the underlying causal regime of thermodynamic openness. It is
  important to underline that our purpose is by no means to provide a <span class="cmti-10">model </span>of closure which would adequately capture the complexity of real biological systems. Rather, we conceive this paper as a
  contribution to characterise in precise terms some of the general features of closure, which might subsequently be used to develop models of biological organisation. Our aim, in other words, is to explicitly state what makes closure a
  distinctive causal regime, characteristically at work in biological systems<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-1002f2">[2]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The structure of the paper is as follows. In section <a href="#x1-20002">2</a>, we specify the main idea which underpins our characterisation of closure. In particular, we put forward an understanding of
  biological self-determination in terms of spatio-temporally localised constraints exerted on physical and chemical processes. In section <a href="#x1-30003">3</a>, we develop specific theoretical and formal
  criteria for drawing a distinction between constraints and processes, which correspond to two regimes of causation. Section <a href="#x1-40004">4</a> goes one step further, by elucidating how the idea of
  dependence among constraints should be conceived in the biological domain. Section <a href="#x1-50005">5</a> introduces closure, as the specific case of <span class="cmti-10">mutual</span>dependence between
  a set of constraints. Section <a href="#x1-60006">6</a> provides a preliminary account of how closure can be used to draw boundaries between interacting biological systems. Finally, in the conclusion, we
  briefly discuss how the present framework conceives the relations between invariance and variation, between stability and change in biological phenomena.

<p class="noindent">The main aim of this paper is to understand organisational closure in terms of the mutual dependence which exists among a set of entities that fulfil the role of <span class="cmti-10">constraints </span>within a system.</p>
<p class="indent">
  What do we mean by constraints? In contrast to fundamental physical equations and their underlying symmetries, constraints are contingent causes<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-2001f3">[3]</sup></a></span>, exerted by specific structures or dynamics, which reduce the degrees of freedom of the system on which they act. As additional causes, they simplify (or change) the description of the system, and enable an
  adequate explanation of its behaviour to be provided, an explanation which might otherwise be under-determined or wrongly determined.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In describing physical and chemical systems, constraints are usually introduced as external determinations (boundary conditions, parameters, restrictions on the configuration space, etc.), which contribute to determining the behaviour
  and dynamics of a system, although their existence does not depend on the dynamics on which they act (<a href="#Xpattee1972nature">Pattee</a>, <a href="#Xpattee1972nature">1972</a>, <a href="#Xpattee1973hierarchy">1973</a>).
  To take a simple example, an inclined plane acts as a constraint on the dynamics of an object sliding or rolling on it, whereas the constrained dynamics (the sliding) do not play a causal role in producing and/or maintaining the plane
  itself. In some cases, however, the constrained dynamics do play a role in determining the conditions of existence of (a subset of) the constraints acting on them; in some specific circumstances, in particular, the existence of each
  constraint depends on the existence of the others, as well as on the action that they exert on the dynamics. In this kind of situation, the set of constraints realises self-determination as organisational closure.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The idea behind this conception of closure is that biological self-determination occurs in the form of <span class="cmti-10">self-constraint</span>. Like all open systems, be they physical or chemical, biological systems are traversed
  by a flow of energy and matter, which takes the form of processes and reactions occurring in open thermodynamic conditions. In this respect, organisms do not differ, qualitatively, from other natural thermodynamically open systems. At
  the same time, however, one of the specificities of biological systems is the fact that the thermodynamic flow is constrained and canalised by a set of constitutive constraints in such a way as to establish a specific form of mutual
  dependence between those very constraints. Accordingly, the organisation of the constraints can be said to achieve self-determination as self-constraint, since the conditions of existence of the constitutive constraints are, because of
  closure, mutually determined within the organisation itself<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-2002f4">[4]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In this paper, we base the theoretical and formal characterisation of closure on the concept of <span class="cmti-10">symmetry </span>(see for example <a href="#Xweyl1983symmetry">Weyl</a> (
  <a href="#Xweyl1983symmetry">1983</a>); <a href="#Xgoodman2009symmetry">Goodman &amp; Wallach</a> (<a href="#Xgoodman2009symmetry">2009</a>)). In very general terms, symmetries refer to transformations that do not change the
  relevant aspects of an object: symmetries and invariants (of energy, momentum, electrical charges, etc.) are therefore complementary concepts, both mathematically and physically. In describing an object, symmetries are relevant in
  relation to different aspects, which might not be spatial in the intuitive sense. For example, the notion that two replicates of an experiment correspond to the same kind of situation relies on an assumption of symmetry between their
  respective behaviours. Another example comes from classical electromagnetism, in which the transformation that inverts all charges (changing positive charges to negative ones and vice versa) does not alter the resulting behaviour, and
  can therefore be understood as a symmetry of the equations involved. In mathematical approaches to natural phenomena, symmetries justify the theories formulated (<a href="#Xvan1989laws">Van Fraassen</a>, 
  <a href="#Xvan1989laws">1989</a>; <a href="#Xbailly2011">Bailly &amp; Longo</a>, <a href="#Xbailly2011">2011</a>; <a href="#Xlongomont">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongomont">2014</a>). In particular,
  symmetries are at the core of the constitution of scientific objects: they ground their theoretical and mathematical characterisation (by defining their description space) and make it possible to write equations describing their
  behaviour (i.e. their specific trajectory) in those situations in which the values of the parameters and initial conditions are specified<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-2003f5">[5]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The theoretical characterisation of closure as a specific kind of symmetry provides, we submit, a principle for understanding the <span class="cmti-10">stabilisation </span>of biological phenomena. One of the authors of this paper has
  recently argued (<a href="#XLongo2011c">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#XLongo2011c">2011</a>, <a href="#Xlongomont">2014</a>) that biological systems can be understood in terms of “extended critical transitions”, which
  mean that they form coherent structures, whose proper<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn6x0" id="fn6x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-2004f6">[6]</sup></a></span> symmetries are inherently unstable. Biological symmetries may change unpredictably, both at the individual and evolutionary scale. In contrast to the role played by theoretical symmetries in the mathematical and
  theoretical definition of physical objects, their instability in the biological domain underlies the fundamental contextuality, variability and historical nature of biological phenomena. In the light of these background assumptions, it
  follows that theoretical symmetries in biology are contingent and can have only a limited temporal range of applicability.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The theoretical framework developed in this paper aims to complement this picture by exploring how biological symmetries can display some degree of stabilisation at the relevant temporal and spatial scales. Constraints correspond to
  theoretical symmetries that are local, in the sense of being stable at limited temporal and spatial scales. These symmetries are related to specific dynamics and structures which constitute biological systems, and which are usually
  investigated (theoretically and experimentally) by biological science. For its part, organisational closure refers to the encompassing causal regime through which constitutive constraints achieve further stabilisation. Given that, ex
  hypothesi, biological symmetries are unstable, biological systems achieve self-determination insofar as organisational closure involves their stabilisation in the long run. As such, closure is at the core of the very constitution of
  biological phenomena as scientific objects.
</p>
<p class="indent">We will come back to the relations between stability and variation in our framework in the conclusion section. Now, let us develop the notion of constraints in more explicit conceptual and formal terms.</p>
<h2 class="sectionHead" id="3--constraints-and-processes"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-30003">3 </span>Constraints and processes</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  The characterisation of closure relies on a theoretical distinction between two different regimes of causation, which we propose to ground in terms of a distinction between <span class="cmti-10">processes </span>and
  <span class="cmti-10">constraints </span>(exerted on the processes).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In a general sense, processes refer to the whole set of changes (typically physical processes, chemical reactions, etc.) that occur in biological systems and involve the alteration, consumption, production and/or constitution of
  relevant entities. Constraints, on the other hand, refer to entities which, while acting upon these processes, can be said <span class="cmti-10">from the appropriate viewpoint </span>to remain unaffected by them. A given theoretical
  entity, as we will see, cannot be qualified as a constraint <span class="cmti-10">per se</span>, but only in relation to a specific process <span class="cmti-10">and </span>the relevant time scale at which this process occurs. This
  context- and scale-dependence is, in our view, a general feature of constraints. In this section, we suggest defining constraints as entities which exhibit a symmetry with respect to a process (or a set of processes) that they help
  stabilise. More formally:

      Similarly, a temporal symmetry is associated with the configuration of an enzyme, which is conserved during the reaction<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn11x0" id="fn11x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-3010f11">[11]</sup></a></span>. Note that at time scales shorter than
      
      <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
        <mi>τ</mi>
      </math>, an enzyme does undergo alterations insofar as it binds to the substrate. The symmetry is respected only by considering the whole process at
      
      <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
        <mi>τ</mi>

</dl>
<p class="indent">Since they meet the two conditions, both the vascular system (with respect to oxygen transport) and enzymes (with respect to the catalysed reaction) can be considered constraints within the organism.</p>
<p class="indent">
  It is of fundamental importance to emphasise that each condition is met <span class="cmti-10">only at the relevant time scale </span>and, in particular, that the time scale
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>τ</mi>
  </math> at which conditions <a href="#x1-30021">I</a> and <a href="#x1-30032">II</a> must be fulfilled is
  the same<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn12x0" id="fn12x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-3011f12">[12]</sup></a></span>. A constraint, to be such, must conserve its relevant aspects at the same time scale at which its causal action is exerted, even though changes and alterations may occur at shorter and/or longer time scales.
  Indeed, it is precisely <span class="cmti-10">because of </span>their conservation that constraints are able to exert their causal power. Consider our two examples. The structure of the organism’s vasculature does not change at those
  time scales at which it channels the flow of oxygen; yet, the structure of the system does change at longer time scales due to the effects, for example, of neovascularisation. The same holds true for enzymes, which are conserved at the
  time scale of catalysis, while decaying and randomly disintegrating at longer scales. Moreover, as mentioned above, enzymes also undergo alterations at shorter time scales (since they bind with the substrate and lose or gain electrons,
  protons, etc.) and are then restored when catalysis is achieved.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The key role of time scales in the definition of constraints should not obscure the fact that the specific definition of a constraint uses other aspects also, such as the spatial scale. Indeed, in order to adequately characterise
  processes, and the constraints acting on them, one must consider the relevant system, and hence the relevant quantity of space (extension, volume, etc.). For example, it is necessary to consider a system large enough to include the flow
  of oxygen and the topology of the vascular system (thus, it must be a system of at least the same size than the vascular system itself). However, while it is of course true that constraints do depend on spatial scales, we maintain that
  this scale does not play a specific role in characterising constraints in the sense that, on a first approximation<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn13x0" id="fn13x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-3012f13">[13]</sup></a></span>, variations in the spatial scale do not affect the symmetries which define them. In contrast, constraints are altered when the temporal scale varies. The proper symmetries of biological constraints can be broken
  over time and, therefore, must be actively maintained or rebuilt within the system (which, as we will see, leads to organisational closure). Moreover, as mentioned in the Introduction, constraints may be reorganised in unpredictable
  ways over time (<a href="#Xlongo2012b">Longo et al.</a>, <a href="#Xlongo2012b">2012a</a>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  A similar point holds true for the levels of description, which can be roughly thought of as the degree of “detail” or “granularity” with which a situation is described at some temporal and spatial scales. In many cases, an equivalence
  can be drawn between the descriptions of constraints at different levels. For instance, the vascular system can be described as a smooth surface forming a tube (its topology) or as a collection of cells clustered together in a specific
  way (with the same “tube” topology). Some levels of description may be more suitable than others for explanatory reasons; and yet, the proper symmetries of the constraints do not vary — again, on a first approximation<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn14x0" id="fn14x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-3013f14">[14]</sup></a></span> — when different levels of description are considered. Accordingly, levels of description do not play a specific role in the characterisation of constraints and are therefore not included in the definition.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Because of their capacity to exert a causal influence on the thermodynamic flow without being influenced by that flow, constraints have, from a thermodynamic perspective, very special features. A description of the causal role of
  constraints in terms of thermodynamic exchanges may possibly be relevant to understanding the intermediate steps leading to the effect (such as the sequence of alterations of an enzyme during catalysis), but would be irrelevant to
  understanding the overall effect, which does not involve a flow between the constraint (or more precisely, its relevant aspects as mentioned in the definition) and the constrained process or reaction.
</p>
<p class="indent">Before moving on, let us first discuss two significant theoretical and epistemological issues, both related to the characterisation of the causal role of constraints.</p>
<p class="indent">
  The first one concerns the fact that, following our definition, a constraint alters the behaviour of a process although, strictly speaking, it does not lead in many cases to new possible behaviours for the constrained process<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn15x0" id="fn15x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-3014f15">[15]</sup></a></span>. More technically, when the set of possibilities are determined by conserved quantities, the latter cannot be altered by fluxes coming from constraints, which are themselves, by definition, conserved through
  (i.e. are symmetric with regard to) the process. For instance, a constraint does not play a role in the balance equation of a given chemical reaction, an equation which is based on the conservation of matter (i.e. the conservation of
  the quantity of every type of atom and electron). That chemical reaction would therefore be possible in principle, but so slow (or, from a molecular viewpoint, so unlikely) that it would require centuries to take place, and would be
  quantitatively irrelevant. The causal role of constraints (here, like enzymes) is to accelerate the reaction enough to actually achieve the result at a shorter (and biologically relevant) time scale.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  By claiming that, in many cases, constraints do not generate new possibilities for the constrained processes, the above remark explicitly suggests that constraints are mostly <span class="cmti-10">limiting</span>, insofar as they
  canalise (condition <a href="#x1-30021">I</a>) the constrained processes toward a specific outcome from among a set of already possible ones. At first glance, this characterisation seems to diverge from related
  analyses of the role of constraints in explaining biological organisation. In particular, as <a href="#XJuarrero1999">Juarrero</a> (<a href="#XJuarrero1999">1999</a>) has pointed out, the constraints at work in biological systems
  are <span class="cmti-10">generative</span>, in the sense that they enable behaviours and outcomes that would otherwise be impossible. Is there a theoretical disagreement here? We believe the distinction between limiting and
  generative constraints corresponds to a difference in the time scale at which their causal effects are described. We maintain that the constrained dynamics or outcomes could in most biological cases occur in an unconstrained way at the
  relevant (very long, or infinite) time scale; yet, at biological (shorter) time scales, constraints are indeed required in order to actually achieve these specific dynamics and outcomes because they contribute to producing otherwise
  improbable (or virtually impossible) effects. In particular, each constitutive constraint within a biological organism enables the maintenance of other constrains as well as, because of closure, the whole system. As a result, although
  constraints are mostly limiting at longer time scales, they can be pertinently conceived as generative at shorter time scales: in this sense, this characterisation is perfectly consistent with our account that claims that biological
  organisation could not exist without the causal action of constraints.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The second issue is related to our understanding of the causal role of constraints stemming from the conjunction of conditions <a href="#x1-30021">I</a> and

  of the constraint are conserved during the constrained process. As discussed above, a flow from the constraint to the process would deplete a state function of the constraint (with respect to the constrained process), which is forbidden
  by definition. In short, there is no flow of matter<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn16x0" id="fn16x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-3015f16">[16]</sup></a></span> or (free) energy (or any conserved quantity) between

  </math> constraints play a causal role in the process. How is such a role to be conceived in this framework? How can constraints be conserved and yet at the
  same time play a causal role? In our view, constraints do not produce their effects by transmitting energy and/or matter to the process, but rather by canalising and harnessing a thermodynamic flow, without being subject to that flow.
  Accordingly, the vasculature channels the blood flow, and the enzyme provides an easier energy path for a reaction.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Even in those cases in which functional constraints, prima facie, appear (see footnote <a href="#x1-3015f16">16</a> above) to transmit energy, we hold that they do in fact channel an energy transfer while
  being conserved. Consider the example of the heart which, according to the usual description, “pumps the blood”: is this a case of a macroscopic constraint which contravenes our definition because it transmits kinetic energy to the
  blood? In our view, such a conclusion stems from an incorrect description of the constraints involved. To see why, let us decompose the situation in which “the heart gives kinetic energy to the blood”. Under the initial conditions,
  blood is located at some point in the body and energy is stored, in a chemical form, in the cardiomyocytes. After pumping (our target process), blood circulation is accelerated and the cardiomyocytes have produced chemical waste. This
  rough decomposition shows that “the heart”, understood as a region of space inside the organism, in fact includes entities (both the blood’s hydrodynamic state and the cardiomyocytes) which, in our framework, should be considered
  processes. What then are the relevant constraints? In this situation, the constraints are the elements of the complex multiscale structure of the heart that channel the transfer of the cardiomyocytes’ chemical energy to the blood’s
  kinetic energy. These elements include (among others) the relevant components of the cardiac cells (mitochondria, sarcomeres, myofibrils), which transform chemical energy into mechanical forces, the geometric architecture of the heart
  and its electric conduction structure that macroscopically shapes these forces both spatially and temporally. All these entities remain approximately (see note <a href="#x1-3004f7">7</a> above) conserved
  after a heart beat, while constraining the release of chemical energy. In short, we could refer to it as the “architecture” of the heart at this time scale, and claim that such an architecture constrains the transformation of the
  chemical energy (
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>A</mi>
  </math>) of cardiomyocytes into the kinetic energy of the blood (
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>B</mi>
  </math>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The central outcome of the theoretical distinction between constraints and processes is a distinction between two regimes of causation. For a given effect of a process or reaction, one can theoretically distinguish, at the relevant time
  scale, between two causes: the inputs or reactants (in Rosen’s terms, the “material” causes) that are altered and consumed through the process, and the constraints (the “efficient” causes, at
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>τ</mi>
  </math>), which are conserved through that very process. Insofar as they are irreducible to the thermodynamic flow, and then to the material inputs or
  reactants, constraints constitute a distinct regime of causation.

<p class="noindent">
  Organisational closure occurs in the specific case of mutual dependence between (at least some of) the constraints acting on a biological system. Before discussing closure as such, let us first focus on the relationship of dependence
  between constraints.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In the previous section, constraints are defined as entities which, at specific time scales, are conserved (symmetric) with respect to the process, and are therefore not the locus of a transfer. However, constraints are typically
  subject to degradation at <span class="cmti-10">longer </span>time scales, and must be replaced or repaired. When the replacement or repair of a constraint depends (also) on the action of another constraint, a relationship of
  dependence is established between the two.

  By way of example, let us consider the production of an enzyme. As discussed above, an enzyme acts as a constraint on the reaction it catalyses. In turn, enzymes are themselves produced by and within the cell, through the translation
  process: ribosomes build the primary sequence of the future protein on the basis of the messenger <span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span> </span>(m
  <span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span></span>) sequence, without consuming it. Since the ribosomes and the m
  <span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span> </span>play a causal role while being conserved during this process, they both act as constraints (at a specific
  time scale) on the production of the enzyme. Consequently, the relationship between the enzyme, the ribosomes and the m
  <span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span> </span>can be pertinently described as a dependence between constraints (in which the enzyme depends on both
  ribosomes and m<span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span></span>), insofar as all of these entities satisfy the definition of constraint at specific time

<p class="indent">
  Slow and fast dependence differ in an interesting way. When the dependent constraint is faster, its stability is quite straightforward because something that changes very slowly seems to stand still from the point of view of something
  faster. In the opposite case, when the dependent constraint is slower (which is actually the case for many chemicals involved in development), then a sustained and stable activity of the faster process is required. As we will suggest in
  the following section, organisational closure <span class="cmti-10">necessarily </span>requires the joint realisation of both kinds of dependence.

  As we will see in the following section, we argue that the notion of direct dependence plays a fundamental role in organisational closure. Although we do not provide in this paper a theoretical justification for this claim, the
  importance of direct dependence is related to the degree of functional integration and complexity realised by biological systems: the very existence of the dynamic organisation requires that the maintenance of each constraint subject to
  closure be under the direct, close control of some other constraints subject to closure. An indirect, and therefore looser, dependence would presumably be incompatible with the requirements for such a high degree of complexity and
  coordination.

  Consider again the example of enzyme formation. The maturation of the protein can be successively constrained by different entities; the catalysis performed by the enzyme depends directly only on the constraint exerted on the last
  process involved. The relevant aspect impacted in this case is the conformation of the protein or, more precisely, its ability to react to the relevant chemicals, and the last process involved is the action of other proteins on the
  endoplasmic reticulum, in eukaryotic cells. Accordingly, the m<span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span> </span>population discussed above is only an
  <span class="cmti-10">indirect </span>generative constraint with respect to the conformation of the protein produced; in turn, it directly contributes to determining the number of proteins produced during the translation process
  discussed above, which is a different aspect of the dependent constraint.

  Overall closure refers then to an organisation in which each constraint is involved in at least two distinct dependence relationships; in other words, each constraint plays the role of both generative and dependent constraint. The
  condition added for strict closure is aimed at ensuring that the definition applies only to one system (rather than two independent systems). In what follows we will use the generic term ’closure’ to refer to strict closure unless
  specified otherwise. The network of all those constraints that meet the three requirements of closure is, we hold, collectively able to self-determine through self-constraint. Note also that the second condition does not require direct
  dependence. The reason is that, while each constraint of
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi mathvariant="bold-script">C</mi>
  </math> does depend directly on another constraint included in the same set, it might (and usually does) contribute to indirectly
  generating other constraints, typically when several constraints act successively on a chain of processes. For example, the shape of proteins depends only indirectly on the m
  <span class="eccc1000-"><span class="small-caps">rna</span> </span>sequence since proteins mature in the endoplasmic reticulum.

<p class="indent">
  As mentioned in the introduction, this characterisation of closure is, of course, very general and schematic, and unable to capture the complexity of its actual realisations by biological systems. Yet at the same time it is precise
  enough to derive several implications.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Firstly, as argued recently (<a href="#Xmossio2009organizational">Mossio et al.</a>, <a href="#Xmossio2009organizational">2009</a>; <a href="#XSaborido01092011">Saborido et al.</a>, 
  <a href="#XSaborido01092011">2011</a>) and mentioned briefly in section <a href="#x1-30003">3</a> above, we claim that constraints subject to closure constitute
  <span class="cmti-10">biological functions</span>. Within this framework, performing a function is equivalent to exerting a constraining action on an underlying process or reaction. All kinds of biological structures and traits to
  which functions can be ascribed satisfy the definition of constraint given above, albeit at various different temporal and spatial scales. In addition to the vascular system and enzymes mentioned above, some intuitive examples include,
  at different scales, membrane pumps and channels (which constrain both the inward and outward flow of materials through the membrane) and organs (such as the heart which constrains the transformation of chemical energy into blood
  movement). Closure is then what grounds functionality within biological systems: constraints do not exert functions when taken in isolation, but only insofar as they are subject to a closed organisation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Secondly, closure should be clearly distinguished from <span class="cmti-10">independence</span>, insofar as a system which realises closure is a physically open system, inherently coupled to the environment with which it exchanges
  energy and matter (<a href="#XNicolis77">Nicolis &amp; Prigogine</a>, <a href="#XNicolis77">1977</a>). This implies in particular that closure is <span class="cmti-10">a context-dependent</span>
  <span class="cmti-10">determination</span>, to the extent that it is always realised with respect to a set of specific boundary conditions, which includes several external (and independent) constraints acting on the system (such as,
  for instance, constraint
  
  <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <msub>
      <mrow>
        <mi>C</mi>

      <mrow>

      </mrow>
    </msub>
  </math>
  in the diagram above). Consequently, closure does not and should not include all the constraints with which the system may have a causal interaction, but rather only the subset of those which fulfils the requirements stated above<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn22x0" id="fn22x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-5006f22">[22]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Thirdly, closure of constraints is different from the underlying open regime of thermodynamic processes since, as discussed in section <a href="#x1-30003">3</a>, constraints are conserved through the
  thermodynamic flow at the relevant time scales. Hence, a description of closure in terms of the causal regime of thermodynamic changes would be inadequate, since it would be unable to include constraints as such and their contribution
  as causal factors. In particular, a description of biological organisation which does not use the causal power of constraints and their closure would amount to a system constituted by a cluster of
  <span class="cmti-10">unconnected </span>processes and reactions, whose coordinated occurrence would be theoretically possible at very long time scales (see the discussion in section
  <a href="#x1-30003">3</a>), but extremely unlikely (virtually impossible) at biologically relevant time scales<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn23x0" id="fn23x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-5007f23">[23]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  To conclude this section, let us discuss in a very preliminary way how closure can be described in practice. As a matter of fact, although closure is different from the thermodynamic flow, it does unfold over time, mainly because the
  various functional constraints do not usually operate simultaneously. Moreover, as mentioned, constraints are such at different time scales, which means that closure is a multiscale causal regime. Jointly considered, these features
  raise the question of how a description of the closed network of dependencies can be obtained. At least two aspects should be mentioned here.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Firstly, a sufficiently long duration has to be considered, in order to include all the relevant time scales (from shorter to longer) at which each constitutive constraint can be described, providing the dynamics of the biological
  system continue to take place. Usually, for example, the description of an adult mammal organism requires the consideration of those constraints exerted on relevant processes with the time scales ranging between a fraction of a second
  (for fast neural or mechanical phenomena) and a substantial fraction of the organism’s lifespan (for slow phenomena which are nevertheless fast enough to be sustained by and within the organisation, such as the maintenance of bone
  structure)<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn24x0" id="fn24x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-5008f24">[24]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Secondly, once the constraints have been included, the organisation of dependencies between them must be described. This can only be done <span class="cmti-10">by abstracting</span>
  <span class="cmti-10">them from the physical time in which they occur</span>, since closure cannot be described at a given point in time, but rather requires us to consider a <span class="cmti-10">set </span>of processes taking
  place at different time scales (some processes may not be permanent, but rather may occur cyclically as is the case with heartbeats, for example). Thus, the whole network of dependencies should be considered as one “block” extended over
  multiple time scales. Accordingly, closure consists of an interdependent relational network of dependencies, extracted from the dynamics of the system in physical time.
</p>
<p class="indent">With this general characterisation in mind, we deal in the next section with the application of closure as a theoretical criterion for drawing <span class="cmti-10">boundaries </span>between systems in the biological domain.</p>
<h2 class="sectionHead" id="6--closure-and-boundaries"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-60006">6 </span>Closure and boundaries</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  In principle, closure constitutes a clear-cut criterion for drawing the boundary between a biological entity and its environment. In organisational terms, in fact, the set of constraints subject to closure define the system, whereas all
  other constraints (and specifically those which have causal interactions with the system), belong to the environment. Accordingly, the ascription of closure to a system calls for a “yes or no” answer, usually based on a topological
  (circular) property of the network of interactions (whatever the underlying mathematical framework). At first glance, this holds true for our characterisation: in our abstract example above, constraints

  do not. Furthermore, as a distinctive and fundamental biological feature, closure is first and foremost supposed to apply<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn25x0" id="fn25x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-6001f25">[25]</sup></a></span> to biological organisms (both unicellular and multicellular cases), the prototypical example of organised systems.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Nevertheless, one may wonder whether (and indeed how), without further specifications, closure can be ascribed to parts of organisms on the one hand, and to systems whose constituents are themselves organisms on the other. In other
  words, the question of the “lower and upper” boundaries of closure calls for a conceptual and formal treatment; in this section, we take some preliminary steps in this direction.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Let us consider first the lower boundaries of closure ascription. The crucial remark is that, in practice, any actual description of closure in biological systems is a partial one, as a complete characterisation of the whole set of
  mutually dependent constraints is usually not available, and constitutes a sort of “theoretical horizon” of biological explanation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Consequently, the incompleteness of current descriptions may generate a dilemma: either closure is to be ascribed to whatever system fit these incomplete descriptions, in which case some parts of biological systems may possibly be taken
  as closed; or closure is to be ascribed only to those systems for which complete descriptions are currently available, in which case virtually no system would meet the requirements.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In order to overcome this difficulty, we suggest the following strategy. In the absence of complete descriptions, closure should only be ascribed to <span class="cmti-10">maximally closed systems</span>, i.e. those systems which
  include all mutually dependent constraints, <span class="cmti-10">in the available description</span>. Maximally closed systems therefore constitute the lowest boundary of closure ascription: in principle, no subsystem of collectively
  dependent constraints that can be shown to belong to an encompassing closed system can be said to realise closure<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn26x0" id="fn26x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-6002f26">[26]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Let us now turn to all those cases in which two or more biological organisms establish a form of mutual dependence due to stable interactions between them, such that each of them can be said to rely on the other(s) for its own
  maintenance. In these situations, in which a fundamental organisational <span class="cmti-10">continuity </span>exists between the interacting organisms, the upper boundaries of closure ascription seem to extend beyond each organism,
  insofar as the notion of maximally closed system applies only to the encompassing system which contains all (known) constraints subject to closure. If we were to limit ourselves to this analysis, it would be impossible to describe
  systems including different nested levels of organisational closure and systems belonging to closed systems (and specifically mutually dependent organisms) would not themselves realise closure as discussed above. Moreover, since
  biological organisms are systematically involved in such interactions it would follow that most of the time individual organisms cannot be said to realise closure. The main theoretical upshot would be a serious weakness for any account
  based on closure, which could not be considered a distinctive property of organisms in many biologically relevant cases. In the remainder of this section, we will address this challenge in a (preliminary) conceptual and formal way. We
  distinguish three different situations in which two or more closed systems realise mutual dependence.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The first situation is that in which the disjunction between the interacting closed systems is straightforward. In this case, either there is no mutual dependence between the two closed systems or, if there is a mutual dependence, then
  the relationship between the systems is, at least in one direction, one of <span class="cmti-10">indirect</span> dependence. To use the technical terms introduced in section <a href="#x1-50005">5</a> above,
  the encompassing system which includes the interacting systems realises overall closure, but <span class="cmti-10">not </span>strict closure. For instance, consider the case of a group of humans in which there is a division of labour,
  with some members being in charge of hunting, and others in charge of cooking. Let us suppose that both hunting and cooking could be pertinently characterised as macroscopic constraints exerted on the flow of energy and matter.
  Collectively, there is some mutual dependence between the members of the group, although the dependence on hunting would presumably be indirect, in the precise sense that the processes constrained by hunting are followed by other
  processes that contribute to the maintenance of the organisation of the members of the group. Of course, a finer-grained description of this kind of dependence would be needed, but we will leave that for a future paper. For the purposes
  of this paper, we simply suppose that many cases of biological interactions could be pertinently described in terms of indirect mutual dependence; thus, the characterisation of closure we provided, which explicitly requires direct
  dependence (so as to capture a distinctive feature of biological integration), makes it possible to exclude these kinds of looser, although mutually beneficial, interactions.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The two other situations that we discuss in the following sub-sections both involve, ex hypothesi, direct mutual dependence between organisms. Firstly, there are cases in which a limited number of individual organisms realise mutual
  dependence, a situation which results in the establishment of an encompassing closed system (such as for instance in the classical example of mutualistic symbiosis). As we will suggest, organisational boundaries can be drawn in this
  case between the interacting organisms, although they do not correspond to strict discontinuities but rather to a quantitative evaluation of the <span class="cmti-10">tendency to closure </span>(section
  <a href="#x1-70006e1">6.1</a>). Secondly, we will examine those cases of <span class="cmti-10">populations or groups </span>of organisms which collectively contribute to the emergence of an encompassing
  closure; cells in multicellular organisms are a paradigmatic example. In this kind of situation, we argue (in section <a href="#x1-80006e2">6.2</a>) that the closure of the collective system may, in some
  conditions, be separated from that realised by the constitutive organisms. Such separation provides the grounds for characterising different <span class="cmti-10">levels </span>of closure.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="61--tendency-to-closure"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-70006e1">6.1 </span>Tendency to closure</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  Let us consider two or more biological organisms (two abstract cells), each of which could be said to realise closure when taken in isolation. Moreover, let us assume that the cells establish strong interactions resulting in direct
  mutual dependence. As a result, the encompassing system is the maximally closed system which realises closure. In this situation, is there a legitimate way to argue that the individual interacting cells also realise closure? As
  mentioned above, closure is usually considered a Boolean property. Here, we propose to apply our characterisation in a different way, and to describe a procedure which enables closed systems to be delimited through the drawing of their
  <span class="cmti-10">spatial </span>boundaries. The general idea is to use a quantitative assessment of the tendency of constraints to be “packed together” in space.

  is a quantitative measure of the dependencies subject to closure (and not just individual constraints), its value will be highly dependent on those constraints which are involved in many dependencies. A good example are membranes,
  which are involved in so many dependencies that their inclusion in the graph would dramatically enhance the tendency to closure of the considered volume.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The tendency to closure is a measure of the degree of organisational integration of organisms and, as well as, an operational tool for drawing the boundaries between them, even when they establish functional dependence. It is worth
  emphasising, in this respect, that such a measure comes in degrees. For example, one can conjecture that the tendency to closure is higher for a unicellular eukaryote than for a cell in a metazoan. Similarly, the tendency to closure
  of a biofilm is arguably weaker than that of an individual bacterium, or a metazoan. The same differences might also emerge when comparing closed systems located at various nested levels of organisation (see the following
  subsection), such as, for instance, in the case of the ant and its colony.
</p>
<p class="indent">Although the above treatment is still preliminary, the formal expression of the tendency to closure (as a quantitative assessment of organised complexity) will hopefully pave the way to future scientific exploration.</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="62--hierarchical-boundaries-of-closure"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-80006e2">6.2 </span>Hierarchical boundaries of closure</h3>
<p class="noindent">
  The tendency to closure makes it possible to identify relevant biological interacting entities in those (widespread) cases in which there is some degree of functional overlap between them. In this sub-section, we discuss a different
  kind of situation, in which a closed organisation is composed of constituents which <span class="cmti-10">themselves </span>realise closure: the paradigmatic example is a multicellular organism made up of its cellular
  constituents.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  One possible view on this situation is that the cells contribute to the realisation of the multicellular organism and are, therefore, also subject to the encompassing closure. Consequently, the boundaries of each individual cell can
  only be drawn by measuring their tendency to closure, as discussed in the previous section.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  However, we submit that this situation has specific properties. Indeed, <span class="cmti-10">individual</span> cells usually do not technically exert a constraint which contributes to the maintenance of the multicellular system.
  Rather, functions subject to multicellular closure are exerted by populations or groups of cells that form <span class="cmti-10">tissues </span>and <span class="cmti-10">organs</span>. In the formal framework proposed in the
  previous section, this situation can be described by emphasising two aspects, both related to the very definition of constraint. Firstly, the contribution of an individual cell does not meet condition
  <a href="#x1-30021">I</a> of the definition of constraint, for the specific reason that its effects on the process are negligible. For example, the contribution of an individual epithelial cell to the
  regulation of insulin levels is negligible. Secondly, individual cells also fail to meet condition <a href="#x1-30032">II</a>, insofar as the relevant symmetries which characterise the constraint are
  respected at higher scales (both spatial and/or temporal) than those at which the individual cells are described. For example, in relation to the constraint exerted on the blood flow by blood vessels, it is fairly apparent that many
  cells are required to obtain the geometrical and topological properties on the basis of which the relevant constraint becomes operational.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Thus, overall, it seems that cells do not usually act as constraints individually, but only collectively, when they are assembled in tissues and organs. Consequently, it follows that in most cases there is no mutual dependence
  between each cell and the encompassing system, enabling their respective closures to be separated, even though they realise a nested hierarchy (the closure of the cells is nested within the closure of the encompassing system). In a
  sense, this implies that the internal functional aspects of the cells can be separated from those aspects that matter for the organism’s organisation. The separation between nested closures provides a straightforward basis for
  drawing the boundaries between organisms<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn30x0" id="fn30x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-8001f30">[30]</sup></a></span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  We conjecture that a relationship between two closures of constraints which involves both separation and a nested hierarchy provides the theoretical basis for characterising, in our framework, a distinction between
  <span class="cmti-10">levels </span>of organisation. Two closed regimes constitute two different levels of organisation if they are both separated and hierarchically nested; accordingly, cells and multicellular organisms
  constitute two different levels of organisation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  We leave a full-fledged analysis of this issue for future work. Let us simply mention that other levels of organisation could presumably be identified beyond the unicellular and multicellular ones: an example could be ecosystems (
  <a href="#XNunes2014">Nunes-Neto et al.</a>, <a href="#XNunes2014">2014</a>). At the same time, not just any level of description would qualify as a level of organisation in this technical sense: arguably, a relatively
  small number of levels could be identified in the biological realm.
</p>
<h2 class="sectionHead" id="7--conclusion-invariance-and-variation"><span class="titlemark" id="x1-90007">7 </span>Conclusion: invariance and variation</h2>
<p class="noindent">
  In this paper, we have argued that the specificity of biological systems lies in their capacity for self-determination as self-constraint. As discussed above, the central idea is that self-constraint occurs in biological systems in
  the form of closure, i.e. a causal regime in which a set of mutually dependent constraints act on the flows of energy and matter so as to collectively maintain themselves, and their organisation, over time. In turn, the fundamental
  formal distinction between the two regimes of causation at work (constraints and processes) relies on the identification of symmetries, and local conservations, at the relevant (temporal) scales.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As a conclusion, we would like to examine an underlying theoretical implication of this framework, already evoked in section <a href="#x1-20002">2</a>, i.e. the fact that closure constitutes a principle of
  stabilisation of biological organisation and, therefore, a fundamental biological invariant. At the same time, the invariance of closure by no means signifies that biological systems are not subject to variability. Let us develop
  this idea.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As argued above, closure takes place in a temporal interval, and can be described by abstracting the network of closed dependencies from the time flow. In this formal framework, the claim according to which closure constitutes an
  “invariant” of biological organisation technically means that a description of closure is possible for any interval long enough to describe a sufficient set of constraints and their mutual dependencies. In other words, given a
  minimum duration, closure is realised for any interval of equivalent duration chosen in the system’s lifetime. The stabilisation of biological phenomena results specifically from the continuous control exerted over processes and
  reactions by functional constraints whose maintenance in the long run depends in turn on their mutual dependence through closure. The invariance of closure grounds the stabilisation of the functional organisation.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Stabilisation, however, does not prevent variation, which may refer to two different kinds of changes. On the one hand, organised constraints can exhibit <span class="cmti-10">negligible </span>variations, i.e. variations which do
  not affect their functional role and do not, therefore, alter the overall organisation. This may be the case when the variation occurs only at short time scales (and is then compensated for), or when then variation is irrelevant
  with regards to the effects of the constraint on the process. On the other hand, biological systems may (and do) undergo <span class="cmti-10">functional </span>changes both throughout their lifespan and over the generations.
  These changes affect the structure and function of one or more constraints, which in turn result in a modification of the organisation. Functional variations are related to many factors, including the life cycle and the interactions
  with the environment, as well as random changes.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In some cases, functional variation threaten the viability of the whole system, and may possibly lead to its break-up<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn31x0" id="fn31x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript" id="x1-9001f31">[31]</sup></a></span>. The crucial thing to bear in mind in this respect, however, is that functional variation is not merely an obstacle for the maintenance of the biological organisation; rather, it is also a crucial requirement
  for the adaptivity, increase in complexity and ultimately the long-term sustainability of life (<a href="#Xkepas2004">Ruiz-Mirazo et al.</a>, <a href="#Xkepas2004">2004</a>). Indeed, in addition to their functional role
  within a specific organised system, constraints also play a role in enabling the emergence of new constraints, new organisations and new behaviours, typically at the evolutionary and populational scales (
  <a href="#Xlongo2012b">Longo et al.</a>, <a href="#Xlongo2012b">2012a</a>; <a href="#Xlongo13">Longo &amp; Montévil</a>, <a href="#Xlongo13">2013</a>). Reciprocally, functional variation alters the organisation
  and yet must be subject to closure in order to be sustained over time. The contingency of biological systems, and their capacity to undergo changes for both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons, justifies the need for the collective
  maintenance of the constraints.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  As biological systems undergo functional variations, their organisation maintains closure, albeit realised in different variants, because of the continuous acquisition of some functions, and the loss of others. In this sense, the
  invariance of closure takes place at a level of description which is <span class="cmti-10">higher </span>than that at which each specific organisation (instantiated by an individual system) occurs. Understood in this way, the
  invariance of closure may be said to be complementary to its functional variation, with both being constitutive principles for biology. In a word, the role of closure as a principle of stabilisation becomes all the more important
  when the contingency of biological systems is placed at the heart of their understanding.

    differences between biological systems on the one hand, and artefacts and other categories of
    natural systems on the other. Intuitively, it seems correct that those situations in which the
    existence of the parts depends on that of the whole system are indeed characteristic
    of biological organisms. The parts of a rock do not dissolve if the whole is broken into
    pieces, just as the components of a computer do not disintegrate if the whole machine is disassembled.

    characterising biological systems is not discussed here. Consequently, we do not explore the
    possibility that some specific classes of non-biological natural systems (such as, for instance, complex
    chemical systems) might be pertinently said to realise closure. For a discussion of this issue, see <a href="#XMossio2014">Mossio &amp; Bich</a>

    statistical nature, as in the case of statistical mechanics, which assume that all microstates with the
    same energy are symmetric, in the specific sense of having the same probability. Similarly, in
    quantum mechanics, two systems in the same state will only yield the same measurement (and thus
    be equivalent) accordance with a statistical distribution. In both cases, the theoretical symmetry
    refers to transformations which, on principle, leave relevant features of the object invariant.

    which has the physical dimension of a time and represents the pace of a dynamics. From a more technical
    viewpoint, a time scale is typically (but not exclusively) obtained by exhibiting a decreasing exponential

    associated with the process (for example describing the return to equilibrium of the process after a perturbation). The time
    scale is then 
    <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
      <mi>τ</mi>
    </math>,
    which characterises the time window in which the relevant aspects take place. In particular, a time
    scale is not necessarily associated with the overall duration of the process that, in some cases, can
    last for arbitrarily large time windows. Consider, for instance, the enzyme lactase in a
    bacterium and assume that there are stationary fluxes of lactose that are constrained by
    this enzyme. These fluxes can last for an arbitrarily long time, yet their time scale is
    determined by the time required to digest a given quantity of lactose inside the cell.
    In the case of the vascular system, the blood circulation time (i.e. the time needed on
    average for blood to travel from one atrium of the heart to the rest of the organism via
    the lungs and the other atrium and back to the same atrium) can be used to obtain
    the relevant time scale. Note that the time scale depends on the specific definition of
    
    <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
      <mi>B</mi>
    </math>, in
    particular in those cases in which different viewpoints are possible. For example, one can focus on a
    single segment of a vein (or an artery), in which case the process would be the displacement of oxygen
    from one side of the segment to the other, and the time scale would be the time (given by the speed of blood 
    <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
      <mo class="MathClass-bin">×</mo>
    </math> the length of the segment) required for such a displacement.

  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn13x0-bk" id="fn13x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">13</sup></a></span> By this we mean that, in the general case, the proper symmetries of the constraints do not
    depend on the spatial scale. However, this may indeed be the case in some specific situations that are not discussed in this paper.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn14x0-bk" id="fn14x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">14</sup></a></span> One may think of situations in which some symmetries are observed only at some levels of
    description. We have no principled objection to this possibility, which would amount
    to the realisation of “strong” emergence among the levels. However, we do not consider
    this situation to be the general one, and leave the analysis of such specific cases for a future paper. See <a href="#XMossio2013">Mossio et al.</a> (<a href="#XMossio2013">2013</a>) for a general philosophical discussion of emergence in relation to biological organisation. See also <a href="#XLongo_2012_From">Longo et al.</a> (<a href="#XLongo_2012_From">2012b</a>) for an analysis of a class of situations in which systems cannot be analysed at a single level, because of
    mathematical singularities and because the relevant symmetry lies <span class="cmti-10">between </span>different levels of
    descriptions.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn15x0-bk" id="fn15x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">15</sup></a></span> Note that the distinction between “possible” and “impossible” situations may
    sometimes be fuzzy insofar as different theoretical frameworks can be used to account for the
    same phenomena (as long as they lead to trajectories that are quantitatively similar).
    Typically, situations that are impossible in one framework might become possible in
    another, in which case these discrepancies have very small probabilities, to the extent that
    they have no experimental or practical relevance (which enables the two viewpoints to
    be compatible). For example, from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics the space of
    macroscopic possibilities may be huge, even though some (most) of them have negligible
    probabilities, while the thermodynamic viewpoint is mostly deterministic and therefore has a
    reduced macroscopic space of possibilities. Technically, in statistical mechanics a huge set
    of macroscopic configurations are possible, but the probabilities of most of them are tiny.

    process. However, there may be a temporary change of the constraint if the corresponding
    (algebraic) quantity is given back to the constraint before the end of the process. For example, consider <span class="small-caps">atp</span>. <span class="small-caps">Atp</span> is not a constraint for a reaction that uses its energy (it is
    consumed): however, it is a constraint for the transformation and transport of the energy of

    folding, and they can be grouped together as a unique (type of) constraint on protein formation.
    Such regroupings may be particularly relevant in those cases in which the entire set of proteins involved is not yet known.

  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn21x0-bk" id="fn21x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">21</sup></a></span> Note also that if, as in the diagram above, each constraint depends on only one other
    constraint, then the organisation has very specific properties: namely, the system forms a <span class="cmti-10">single</span>
    closed chain of dependent constraints (a closed subset would break the chain). On the contrary,
    there can be multiple closed subsystems when constraints generate and/or depend on
    multiple constraints. Biological cases correspond to the second situation: for instance, many
    constraints depend on the cellular membrane, on ribosomes or on the vascular system.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn22x0-bk" id="fn22x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">22</sup></a></span> The distinction between constitutive and non-constitutive constraints relies mainly on the
    definition of dependence established in the previous section. In fact, most external constraints do
    have causal interactions with the system and, consequently, either affect it or are affected by it. Yet,
    even when it can be shown that a non-constitutive constraint interacts with the closed system (in
    which case one may wonder whether or not it is subject to its closure), it should be also shown that,
    in accordance with the definition, the relationship of dependence is direct and, moreover, concerns the <span class="cmti-10">relevant aspects </span>thanks to which the entity satisfies the definition of constraint, at the relevant scale.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn23x0-bk" id="fn23x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">23</sup></a></span> This implication makes it possible to distinguish between a closure of constraints and a
    cycle of processes or reactions such as, for instance, the hydrologic cycle. In the case
    of cycles, the entities involved (e.g. clouds, rain, springs, rivers, seas, clouds, etc.) are
    connected to each other in such a way as to generate a cycle of transformations and changes.
    In turn, these entities do not act as constraints on each other, and the system can be
    adequately described by appealing to a set of external boundary conditions (ground, sun, etc.) which act on a single causal regime of thermodynamic changes (see also <a href="#XMossio2013">Mossio et al.</a> (
    <a href="#XMossio2013">2013</a>)).
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn24x0-bk" id="fn24x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">24</sup></a></span> Closure depends on the processes that are considered and their corresponding time scale.
    For example, the transport of blood in a blood vessel can be considered globally (for example
    average time to travel from the heart to the organs and back again to the heart), or more locally
    (time spent inside a capillary). Processes may also be described in more or less detail. Typically,
    different processes may be grouped together, and some aspects of the systems can be ignored. This is
    particularly the case when, in the context of closure, one is studying a specific part of an
    organism that is not (much) dynamically impacted by some other aspects of the closed system.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn25x0-bk" id="fn25x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">25</sup></a></span> It is worth recalling that from our perspective, although an organism necessarily realises
    closure, a system realising closure is not necessarily an organism. In other words, closure does not <span class="cmti-10">define </span>the notion of organism: see <a href="#Xmatteobook">Moreno &amp; Mossio</a> (
    <a href="#Xmatteobook">2015</a>) for an analysis of this issue.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn26x0-bk" id="fn26x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">26</sup></a></span> Accordingly, a conceptual distinction can be made between “mutual dependence” and
    “closure”: while the former is realised by any (sub)set of entities which depend directly on each other,
    the latter is realised by the set of all entities which are mutually dependent within a system. So for
    instance, although the heart and lungs are mutually dependent, only the whole set of organs forming the organism realises (ex hypothesi) closure.
