<p class="indent">
  Two main theories aim at understanding carcinogenesis: the reductionist <span class="small-caps">smt</span> locates cancer in cancer cells, while the organicist <span class="small-caps">toft</span> locates cancer at the tissue
  level. For <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, the ‘cancer cell’ is a phlogiston, <span class="small-caps">smt</span> is an old paradigm which ought to be replaced. Recently two critics have argued that
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> and <span class="small-caps">smt</span>, despite their apparent strong incompatibilities, are actually compatible. Here we review their arguments. We show that these arguments are based on
  interpretation mistakes that become understandable once one grants that criticizing a paradigm from the point of view of another, in which words do not have the same signification, bears the risk of strong misunderstandings. These
  misunderstandings, in our experience, are common. We hope that this discussion will help clarifying the differences between <span class="small-caps">toft</span> and <span class="small-caps">smt</span>.

  Cancer is no more of a disease of cells than a traffic jam is a disease of cars. A lifetime of study of the internal combustion engine would not help anyone to understand our traffic problems. The causes of congestion can be many. A
  traffic jam is due to failure of the normal relationship between driven cars and their environment and can occur whether they themselves are running normally or not.

<h2 class="sectionHead" id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="indent">
  Two main theories strive to explain carcinogenesis: the Somatic Mutation Theory (<span class="small-caps">smt</span>), and the Tissue Organization Field Theory (<span class="small-caps">toft</span>).
  <span class="small-caps">S</span><span class="small-caps">mt</span> adopts a reductionist stance and fundamentally attributes cancer to genetic defects in cells. It has dominated the field of cancer biology for the past 50 years but
  has met difficulties, both in terms of empirical evidence and lack of medical impact, so that one of its main proponents mourns that after a period of “reductionist triumphalism” we are now back to “endless complexity”
  (Weinberg, 2014, p. 267). <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span>, by contrast, adopts an organicist stance, and postulates that cancer is primarily tissue disorganization (Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999).
  According to its proponents, it has met notable empirical success (Baker, 2011).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Two critics have recently aimed at showing that <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> are actually compatible, and both reductionist (Bedessem and Ruphy, 2015, 2016). The claim, at first,
  is surprising, since it contradicts the declarations of the very authors of <span class="small-caps">toft</span>.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Philosophical papers, however, can be wrong, like experimental papers, for methodological reasons. The two critics, as we will see, failed to cite the relevant literature, mis-cited the literature cited, and misrepresented basic
  concepts in <span class="small-caps">toft</span>. They grounded their account on a criticism of Marcum’s (2009) account of scientific reduction, an account which is held neither by the tenants of
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> nor by many philosophers of science. Crucial to their argument was their assumption that “tissues are considered as an ensemble of cells” (2015, 263), an assumption which is held neither by
  the tenants of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> nor, to our knowledge, by any biologist.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  We first briefly introduce <span class="small-caps">toft</span> and <span class="small-caps">smt</span>. We then critically review the arguments of the critics. We argue that their mistakes are not fortuitous but can be
  interpreted as an illustration of the strong divergence between the <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> paradigms. Our aim here is not to argue for <span class="small-caps">toft</span>,
  but for a precise characterization of <span class="small-caps">toft</span>. Whatever the future of cancer biology holds, understanding the originality of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> is a prerequisite to assessing its
  theoretical and experimental fruitfulness.

<p class="indent">
  The Somatic Mutation Theory of cancer traces back to the beginning of the XXth century and has progressively mutated to become the dominant view in the past 50 years (Boveri, 1914; Soto and Sonnenschein, 2014).<a href="#ftn1" id="body_ftn1" class="Footnote_20_anchor">[1]</a> <span class="small-caps">S</span><span class="small-caps">mt</span> states, in a nutshell, that cancer is a cell-based disease driven by somatic <span class="small-caps">dna</span> alterations which
  increase cell proliferation (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). Accordingly, most carcinogens are assumed to be so in virtue of being mutagenic.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  At the core of carcinogenesis is the appearance of ‘cancer cells’. These cancer cells are assumed to be the product of several successive mutations (on oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, <span class="small-caps">dna</span> repair
  genes, etc.) which, supposedly, make these cells proliferate more, leading to their higher fitness (in the population genetics sense).<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  See e.g. Nowak, Michor and Iwasa (2003)."><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">[2]</a>
</span>Normal cells are assumed to be quiescent by default and to require ‘signals’ in order to prolifer<span id="Ref_x1-4003f3">ate.</span><a href="#ftn3" id="body_ftn3" class="Footnote_20_anchor">[3]</a> Cancer cells do not. As a result, cancer is assumed to be a
  (problematic) self-sustained cell proliferation.
</p>
<p class="indent">It follows that the main therapeutic strategy stemming from the <span class="small-caps">smt </span> is to target these cancer cells and kill them selectively. This strategy is facing a crisis due to its limited medical outcomes (Lichtenberg, 2010; Godlee, 2016).</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="small-caps">S</span><span class="small-caps">mt</span> is thus centered at the cellular level. It professes a reductionist stance. It combines molecular and cell biology, to seek for molecular alterations mediating
  carcinogenesis, and a population genetics rationale to justify the amplification of single cell defects.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="22-toft-the-tissue-as-a-focus">2.2 <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span>: the tissue as a focus</h3>
<p class="indent">
  The Tissue Organization Field Theory has been proposed by Sonnenschein and Soto (1999). It takes place in a broader stream of works questioning the level at which cancer takes place.<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: See for example Berenblum and Shubik (1949), Brinster (1974), Pierce et al (1974), Kenny and Bissell (2003), Bizzarri et al (2008), Barcellos-Hoff (2010). We thank a reviewer for suggesting these references to us."><a href="#ftn4" id="body_ftn4">[4]</a></span> <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> states that cancer is essentially a developmental disease, occurring at the level of the tissue. Carcinogenesis is understood as a disorganization of the morphogenetic
  field of the tissue.<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: Technically, organization should be understood here as the mutual dependencies between the parts of an organism, which can to an extent be proper to an individual (Montévil and Mossio, 2015). Cancer is then characterized by an increase of morphological complexity and a loss of organization (Longo et al, 2015)."><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5">[5]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, the default state of the cell is proliferation with variation and motility. Healthy tissues impose constraints on cell proliferation (via mechanical forces, chemical inhibitors, etc.).<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  Applications of this notion of default state can be found in Ginzburg and Colyvan (2004); Soto, Longo, Montévil and Sonnenschein (2016); Montévil, Speroni, Sonnenschein and Soto (2016). Montévil et al. (2016) also discusses the default state used in several mathematical models of mammary gland morphogenesis."><a href="#ftn6" id="body_ftn6">[6]</a></span> However, a disruption of tissue organization can release those constraints, resulting in cell proliferation with variation and motility, and in further disorganization of the tissue. Carcinogens are assumed to be so in virtue of
  altering the tissue architecture (e.g. asbestos), or of interfering with development (e.g. endocrine disruptors).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Cancer occurs at the tissue level, with phenomena such as dysplasia and metaplasia. The appearance of carcinoma (epithelial cancer), for instance, fundamentally involves reciprocal interactions between the two main parts of the
  considered tissue, the epithelium which typically proliferates abnormally, and the stroma which surrounds the epithelium. Being a ‘cancer cell’ is not a genuine property of the cell: ‘cancer cells’ do not acquire new competences,
  and they can be normalized if placed in an appropriate tissue (this contradicts the population genetics view of <span class="small-caps">smt</span>).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> thus finds its home in developmental biology. It adopts an organicist perspective where the tissue is the focal level, at the cross-road of both bottom-up (e.g. cell
  and extra-cellular matrix to tissue) and top-down approaches (e.g. organism to tissue).

    <span class="cmti-10">, the example of mammary glands.</span> In <span class="small-caps">smt</span> (left), normal epithelial cells are quiescent by default: this state does not require an explanation (but see footnote 3).
    Carcinogenesis is then a process in which a series of mutations leads to the advent of cancer cells which proliferate and move spontaneously. In <span class="small-caps">toft</span> (right), normal tissue constrains the
    proliferation and motility of cells, leading to tissue homeostasis. Carcinogenesis is characterized by a disruption of the normal tissue organization that leads to the loss of these constraints and to abnormal proliferation, cell
    movements and further abnormal tissue architecture. The above schematics are highly simplified for representation purpose. For <span class="small-caps">smt</span>, see Hanahan and Weinberg (2011, Fig. 2). For
    <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, we focus on the effect of constraints on a single epithelial cell to lighten the representation.

<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="23-reductionism-and-organicism">2.3 Reductionism and organicism</h3>
<p class="indent">At this point the reductionist reader might wonder how a whole can have properties which are irreducible to properties of its parts, as do tissues in <span class="small-caps">toft</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">
  To show this, we shall consider a balloon as a toy example. The balloon is, topologically, a sphere. The topology of the balloon is not, obviously, a property of one single rubber molecule. But an immediate temptation is to reduce
  the topology of the balloon to the individual positions of all the rubber molecules. Yet, these individual positions are insufficient: what is lacking is, precisely, the topological relationships between the molecules, their
  neighborhoods, their connections, so to speak. More precisely, the topology of the balloon is a property of the possible transformations of the shape of the balloon: whether it is stretched or bumped, inflated or soft, as long as we
  make no hole in it, its topology remains the same. The topology of the balloon is a conserved property of the whole which is not reducible to properties of the parts.<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  Another example is in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic phenomena are oriented in the sense that some thermodynamic processes are irreversible. However, the trajectory of every single molecule is reversible in classical mechanics. Irreversibility is a property of the system and not of the elements. A century of hard mathematical work and the edification of non trivial hypotheses have been necessary to articulate the two levels. [See for example Chibbaro, Rondoni and Vulpiani (2014), Bitbol (2012), Longo, Montévil and Pocheville (2012), and Longo and Montévil (2014)]."><a href="#ftn7" id="body_ftn7">[7]</a></span>
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Similarly, the organization of the tissue is not reducible to properties of parts of the tissue. The topological properties of an acinus, for instance, cannot be defined at a level lower than that of the acinus itself. Arguably,
  there is more to biology than conserved tissue-level properties such as topology (as we and colleagues argued in Montévil et al, 2016), but there is hardly less.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Now, <span class="small-caps">toft</span> is also more than just non-reductionist: it is organicist. We cannot do better to explain organicism than to recall a passage by Gilbert and Sarkar (the importance of the quote will soon
  become obvious):
</p>
<p class="indent quote">
    [R]eductionism [can be pictured] as a system where a “bottom-up” approach (e.g., atoms to molecules to organelles to cells to tissues) is sufficient to explain all phenomena. Organicism claims that this
  is not sufficient and that top-down and bottom-up approaches must both be used to explain phenomena. For instance, reductionistic ontology and explanations would see a tissue as an organized collection of cells and cells as an
  organized collection of organelles, etc. Organicist ontology and explanations would include those bottom-up considerations but would also include the functioning of the tissue within the organism, the functioning of the organism
  within its environment (and, perhaps, other parameters as well). The structure and function of a hepatocyte depends not only on the properties of organelles comprising it, but also on the properties of the organ in which it resides.
  (Gilbert and Sarkar, 2000, p. 2)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  In <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, ‘organization’ thus includes bottom-up and top-down relations. It is “a dynamic state of interdependence of levels that includes both structures and functions as well as integration and
  regulation” (Longo et al., 2015, p. 965).
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="24-relationships-between-smt-and-toft">2.4 Relationships between <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span></h3>
<p class="indent">
  Roughly speaking, for <span class="small-caps">smt</span>, cancer is in the cell; for <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, cells are in the cancer. In Table 1, we gather the various core aspects of
  <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> discussed in the previous section.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  An immediate temptation – which we have encountered several times in discussions with colleagues external to <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, and which is advocated by the critics we respond to here – is to say that
  <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> provide alternative, compatible causal pathways targeting the same domain of validity (cancer). In this sense, genetic mutations and tissue disruption
  would be two pathways to obtain the same phenomenon, as would for instance different forces in Newtonian mechanics. The coexistence of different forces in Newtonian mechanics, however, does not lead to a logical inconsistency. We
  consider that a close examination of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> reveals differences with respect to <span class="small-caps">smt</span> which lead to the conclusion that they are actually logically incompatible (in
  particular because <span class="small-caps">toft</span> supposes a default state of proliferation, which <span class="small-caps">smt</span> does not). The coexistence of <span class="small-caps">smt</span> explanations and
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> explanations targeting a single phenomenon is thus not as straightforward as it seems.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The question of the incompatibility between <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> is, of course, orthogonal to that of their respective validity. For instance, quantum mechanics and general
  relativity are logically incompatible, but they both have their domain of validity, and issues only appear in the small overlap of these domains. <span class="small-caps">S</span><span class="small-caps">mt</span>, for instance, could
  be valid for some cancers (say, ‘cell cancers’) and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> for others (say ‘tissue cancers’).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The two theories can also be speculatively mutated to incorporate elements of the other while retaining their core assumptions (i.e. cell/tissue as for the level, quiescence/proliferation as for the default state).
  <span class="small-caps">S</span><span class="small-caps">mt</span> can be extended to include an effect on gene regulation by the cellular micro-environment (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) – though not by the tissue, which is not a proper
  level of action in this scheme. <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> might be extended by considering that somatic mutations can play a role in relieving constraints stemming from the tissue, if they can
  affect the whole organization field.
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Finally, the cores of both theories might be speculatively mutated to formulate a grand overarching theory of cancer (say, <span class="small-caps">‘</span><span class="small-caps">smtoft</span><span class="small-caps">’</span>), one where
  <span class="cmti-10">tissues</span> would constrain cells but where the fact that cells can proliferate and move <span class="cmti-10">with intrinsic, heritable, varying rates</span> by default would also play a key explanatory
  role (Capp, 2012; Rosenfeld, 2013).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Theories can be multiplied beyond necessity. Whether their multiplication or unification are timely and useful depends on how much one is able to articulate the alternative points of view and to approach critically empirical
  results. Premature unification, in particular, is at risk of leaving aside genuine changes of perspective brought by the youngest alternatives. In the next section, we give an example of critics falling, we think, into that trap.

  Two critics have recently argued that <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span> are compatible and both reductionist (Bedessem and Ruphy, 2015, 2016). To do so, we will see that they had to

</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="31-the-importance-of-development">3.1 The importance of development</h3>
<p class="indent">
  Surprisingly, the critics ended up talking about <span class="small-caps">toft</span> without mentioning development. However, <span class="small-caps">toft</span> considers cancer as a developmental disease where neoplasms are
  “development gone awry” (Soto, Maffini and Sonnenschein, 2007). The importance of development in cancer biology could be debated, but it is central to <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, including at the level of the
  experimental methods involved such as recombination experiments. An example of application is the analysis of endocrine disruptor as carcinogens (Soto and Sonnenschein, 2010).

<p class="indent">
  In carcinoma, <span class="small-caps">smt</span> looks inside epithelial cells: ‘the cancer cells’. The other cells are not the main focus of investigation. <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> instead
  focuses on the tissue level, and in particular on the relations between the epithelium and the stroma, and looks inside these components. The stroma includes cells, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, adipocytes, and all of them play
  an important role. The critics do not specify which cells they talk about and seem to confuse the stroma and the cellular micro-environment or maybe the extra-cellular matrix.

<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="33-the-importance-of-theory">3.3 The importance of theory</h3>
<p class="indent">The critics adopt the most deflationary possible position in the debate, seemingly forgetting that it is, for <span class="small-caps">toft</span> advocates such as Soto and Sonnenschein, all about theories:</p>
<p class="indent quote">Their [Soto and Sonnenschein’s] central idea is that the original cause of cancer is not genetic mutations, but disruption of tissue cohesion. (2015, p. 258)</p>
<p class="indent">
  The central idea of Soto and Sonnenschein is to propose a new theory of cancer. To them, briefly put, a theory is based on core assumptions, including a default state (Longo et al., 2015; Soto et al, 2016). Theories are conditions
  of possibility of explanations in that they define causal structures in which particular causes can then act (Sonnenschein and Soto, 2008). The central idea of Soto and Sonnenschein is certainly not to add yet another kind of cause
  to an otherwise poorly defined picture of cancer. This deflationary reading by the critics, who reduce a theory to a piece of mechanism, is a thread in their misunderstanding of the incompatibility between
  <span class="small-caps">smt</span> and <span class="small-caps">toft</span>:
</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  Our suggestion is that, from a biological perspective, the two theories have to be thought as proposing two distinct, and compatible, <span class="cmti-10">causal pathways</span> which can initiate and promote carcinogenesis.
  (2015, p. 264, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  By contrast, as we argued above, a close reading of the <span class="small-caps">toft</span> literature rules out this interpretation. Similarly, the critics refuse to discuss the notion of default state (2016, p. 4), which is by
  contrast crucial to the view they criticize.<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  To be fair, the critics do cite Rosenfeld (2013) for this abdication, but Rosenfeld only explains that he does not understand the notion."><a href="#ftn9" id="body_ftn9">[9]</a></span> Eventually, this deflationary reading by the critics explains why they have so great troubles identifying <span class="small-caps">toft</span> authors in several places. (For instance they write on p. 258 of their 2015 paper that
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> has been ‘popularized’ by Soto and Sonnenschein.)
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="34-the-importance-of-the-philosophical-method">3.4 The importance of the philosophical method</h3>
<p class="indent">
  To argue for the non-anti-reductionism of <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, the critics implement the most improbable philosophical method: they criticize (with, we argue, mistakes) a somewhat confidential paper (Marcum, 2009),<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  The critics cite what seems to be another version of the same paper (Marcum, 2010), which we were not in a position to find."><a href="#ftn10" id="body_ftn10">[10]</a></span>

Another paper by the same author has been sometimes cited in the toft literature (Marcum, 2005)."><a href="#ftn11" id="body_ftn11">[11]</a></span> </span>only because, apparently, this paper mentions <span class="small-caps">toft</span>:
</p>
<p class="indent quote">This definition [of organicism] is interesting since Marcum presents <span class="small-caps">toft</span> as an organicist theory. As a consequence, it is a way to investigate the coherence of this claim. (2015, p. 262)</p>
<p class="indent">
  It would have been more appropriate to start with the concepts of reductionism and organicism found in Gilbert and Sarkar (2000, quoted above), which is abundantly cited, in particular in <span class="small-caps">toft</span>.
  Deceived by their false start, the critics go on confusing two very different stances, organicism and (the most naïve possible) holism:
</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  In biology, <span class="cmti-10">holism</span> translates into <span class="cmti-10">organicism</span> …[In the holistic view], it is epistemologically useless to consider the smallest scales to study a given object. (2015, p.
  262, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Unfortunately, the quote completely contrasts with a passage by Soto and Sonnenschein, already quoted from “we advocate” in the paper by Marcum (2009, p. 279) which the critics cite at length (see also e.g. Soto, Sonnenschein and
  Miquel (2008, p. 16)):
</p>
<p class="indent quote"><span class="cmti-10">Neither Evelyn Fox-Keller, nor us ‘advocate a holistic view’. Fox-Keller proposes ‘explanatory pluralism’ (Keller, 2002, p. 300), and we advocate a hierarchical view of biology that recognizes the existence of emergent phenomena
and their causative powers. In this view both top-down and bottom-up approaches are used (Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999).
</span>(Soto and Sonnenschein, 2005, p. 460, with modified citation format and our emphasis)</p>
<p class="indent">The critics then go on using Marcum’s confidential and idiosyncratic account of reductionism (which they deem “classical”, 2015, p. 264), to make the central point of their paper:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  J-A. Marcum defines three types of reductionism (Marcum, 2010). <span class="cmti-10">Theoretical reductionism</span> aims at reducing the terms of a high-level theory to terms belonging to low-level theories. …
  <span class="cmti-10">Ontological reductionism</span> deals with the description of the elementary components of natural objects or phenomena. …Finally, <span class="cmti-10">methodological reductionism</span> is related to the
  scientific techniques used to decompose the hight-order [sic] entities into their low-order elements. <span class="textbf">[These are not definitions</span>
  <span class="textbf"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  To be fair, we refer the reader to Marcum (2009, p. 269) who, we think, is more precise."><a href="#ftn12" id="body_ftn12">[12]</a></span>
</span><span class="textbf">]</span> (2015, p. 263, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">They aim at showing that with such an account, <span class="small-caps">toft</span> is reductionist.</p>
<p class="indent">We start with the so-called theoretical reductionism. While ‘reducing terms’ is nothing like ‘reducing theories’ (see references in the Appendix), it is still much better than what the critics do with it:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  Soto and Sonnenschein’s works rigorously use the same vocabulary as the one used in classical molecular biology. <span class="small-caps">toft</span> talks about <span class="cmti-10">cells, stroma, genes</span>. It does not
  consider new terms that we [sic] could not be reduced to words referring to elementary components. …Thus, as regards <span class="cmti-10">theoretical </span><span class="cmti-10">reductionism</span>,
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> cannot be said to be anti-reductionnist. (2015, p. 263, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Happily, the critics count the words. With such a line of reasoning, “Julia eats her ice-cream” and “Her ice-cream eats Julia” mean the same thing, since they are composed of the same words. However, even indulging for ice-cream,
  they are blatantly wrong. <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> makes a central use of the (irreducible) notion of <span class="cmti-10">tissue field</span>, as rightfully noted for instance by Bertolaso
  (2016, p. xi). The notion of ‘constraint on the default state’ has been introduced in a paper cited by the critics (Sonnenschein et al., 2014), and further elaborated (Longo et al., 2015; Soto et al, 2016). In addition to
  considering new terms, <span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> also excludes several theoretical notions such as ‘cancer cell’, ‘information’, and ‘growth factor’ (Sonnenschein and Soto, 2011; Longo et al.,
  2012; Sonnenschein and Soto, 1999). The latter, for instance, is excluded in virtue of the theoretical choice of the default state. (The word is still used, of course, as many molecules, such as Fibroblast Growth Factor or
  Insulin-like Growth Factors have it in their common scientific name.)
</p>
<p class="indent">The critics are not luckier with the so-called ontological reductionism:</p>
<p class="indent quote"><span class="small-caps">T</span><span class="small-caps">oft</span> gives more importance to tissues, but the tissues are considered as an ensemble of cells, and the cancer remains a cellular disease. (2015, p. 263)</p>
<p class="indent">
  Unfortunately, first, tissues also include the extra-cellular matrix and many other parts. Second, <span class="small-caps">toft</span> emphasizes the <span class="cmti-10">organization</span> of tissues. The reduction of the
  tissue to its cellular components is the critics’s own assumption. Following them, organisms are ensembles of cells, and all diseases are actually cellular diseases, including auto-immune diseases and aneurysms. Pushing this line of
  reasoning one step further, all diseases are molecular diseases or even diseases of subatomic particles.
</p>
<p class="indent">Now comes the methodological reductionism:</p>
<p class="indent quote">The experimental protocols developed by the partisans of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> do consider cells and molecules, hence their methodologically reductionist stance. (2015, p. 263)</p>
<p class="indent">
  This is a far cry from what Marcum, from whom they borrow the concept, would endorse: “Researchers utilize this type of reductionism to investigate just the elements or parts and not the complex entity as a whole.” (Marcum, 2009, p.
  269). Methodologically speaking, <span class="small-caps">toft</span> does not consider ‘just’ the elements or parts. The hypothesis that there is no such thing as a cancer cell implies that one has to consider at least simplified
  tissues (in tissue culture) in order to be able to discuss the disease. In general, the ultimate proofs are <span class="cmti-10">in vivo</span>, and the work of the Soto and Sonnenschein laboratory includes 2D culture, 3D culture,
  explants, transplants and <span class="cmti-10">in vivo</span> work. They clearly state their method: they propose to start from the level at which the phenomenon is defined and to go up and down the scales (Soto, Sonnenschein and
  Miquel, 2008, pp. 11, 13), as does Noble with his middle-out approach (Noble, 2006).
</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, after having missed what it means for <span class="small-caps">toft</span> to define a tissular level, the critics prefer to focus on inside/outside relationships defined at the cellular level:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  Thus, rather than considering a <span class="cmti-10">cellular</span> and a <span class="cmti-10">tissular</span> scale, we prefer to use the notions of <span class="cmti-10">interior</span> and
  <span class="cmti-10">exterior</span> of the cell. (2015, p. 264, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">They then claim that the definitions proposed by Marcum are inconsistent with the anti-reductionist claims in <span class="small-caps">toft</span>:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  This remark does not mean that <span class="small-caps">toft</span> is strictly reductionist, in all the possible meanings of this concept. It just shows that the assertion that <span class="small-caps">toft </span><span class="cmti-10">is an organicist theory</span> is not coherent with the conception of reductionism and organicism it is based on. This idea is not only applicable to Soto and Sonnenschein’s work, since other authors, as
  Marcum (2010), consider <span class="small-caps">toft</span> as an organicist theory without coherent and strong arguments. (2015, p. 265, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  Unfortunately, to substantiate this claim, the critics do not cite any paper on organicism but Marcum’s. This is unfortunate because, as the critics themselves note in their conclusion, the question of organicism was their very
  subject:
</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  …[T]his claim for an integration of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> and <span class="small-caps">smt</span> is not new (Marcum, 2010; Rosenfeld, 2013; Coffman, 2005). However, our original contribution [was to] …question the
  relevance of the reductionism/organicism opposition in the field of carcinogenesis …(2015, p. 266)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  This failure to cite the literature relevant to the core of their argument comes, we think, from a biased reading of the <span class="small-caps">toft</span><span class="small-caps">/</span>
  <span class="small-caps">smt</span> literature.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="35-the-importance-of-pluralism">3.5 The importance of pluralism</h3>
<p class="indent">The critics compare their view to the integrative pluralism of Mitchell (2004). They only wave, however, at a plurality of causes (see also e.g. 2016, p. 5), they never flesh out a pluralism of models, not to speak of theories:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  Insofar as <span class="small-caps">toft</span> and <span class="small-caps">smt</span> describe two compatible causal pathways, they can be integrated in a single approach to explain carcinogenesis. And this integration [of
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> and <span class="small-caps">smt</span>] is of a <span class="cmti-10">higher epistemological value</span> than <span class="small-caps">smt</span> or <span class="small-caps">toft</span> taken
  separately. (2015, p. 265, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">The critics never show how “this integration” would be feasible, neither why it would be of higher epistemological value. It is however unclear which pluralism they defend:</p>
<p class="indent quote">This view [the plurality of causes] is closed [sic] to the ideas exposed by Sandra D. Mitchell about biological complexity (Mitchell, 2002, 2004). (2015, p. 265)</p>
<p class="indent">
  Indeed, Mitchell (2004) has inflected her integrative pluralism to explicitly argue against Kim’s physicalism in science, a physicalism that the critics vividly hold (see below). Eventually, their pluralism seems to boil down to the
  mere non-elimination of any theory:
</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  In other words, available scientific data suggest a <span class="cmti-10">limitation of the domain of validity</span> of <span class="small-caps">smt</span>, but they do not establish that the explanation of carcinogenesis provided
  by <span class="small-caps">smt</span> is <span class="cmti-10">never</span> valid. (2016, p. 2, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  This is, however, a classical induction problem. To take a comparison, Lavoisier never proved that the phlogiston theory was never valid (actually, it did a great job at explaining the properties of metals, see Kuhn (1962, pp. 99,
  148)). He just proposed another one.
</p>
<h3 class="subsectionHead" id="36-the-non-importance-of-physicalism">3.6 The (non-)importance of physicalism</h3>
<p class="indent">
  The main piece in the 2016 follow-up paper is a manifesto by the critics in favor of physicalism. Being charitable, they do not think that their targets may have a different view than theirs. Here again, however, they have missed a
  crucial paper:
</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  However, their response to our article enables us to identify a confusion often made by the proponent of <span class="small-caps">toft </span><span class="textbf">[Unfortunately, the critics do not give any reference]</span>: if
  they are opposed to a certain form of genetic reductionism, they are not opposed to reductionism in general. To be authentically anti-reductionist, they have to define a level of organization which would be ontologically different
  <span class="textbf">[This is the tissue]</span> that [sic] the one used in the frame of <span class="small-caps">smt</span> (that is to say, individual cells). To take a comparison, the advocate of an anti-reductionist view of
  carcinogenesis would have to explicitly consider that there is the same difference between <span class="cmti-10">a tissue</span> and <span class="cmti-10">an ensemble of cells</span> that [sic] between
  <span class="cmti-10">the mental level</span> and <span class="cmti-10">an ensemble of neurons</span>. Second, they would have to show that this new level of organization has a causal power on the cells which cannot be reduced to
  the physical interactions between the cells and their environment. In other words, they have to defend the existence of an authentic <span class="cmti-10">top-down causality</span> from the tissue to the cells
  <span class="textbf">[They do: see Soto, Sonnenschein and Miquel (2008)]</span>. Yet, this question of the top-down causality is tricky. Following (Kim 1988) [sic<span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote:  We cite him here as Kim (1998)."><a href="#ftn13" id="body_ftn13">[13]</a></span>], we think that the <span class="cmti-10">closure of the physical world</span> is a fundamental principle which is hard to deny. (2016, p. 3, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">Soto, Sonnenschein and Miquel (2008, p. 5-7) have however argued that causal closure is founded on a principle itself ‘based on a hidden logical fallacy’:</p>
<p class="indent quote"><span class="cmti-10">…Kim jumps from the level of a finite system to the level of the world. How is it possible to make this jump? Obviously this cannot be done on science alone! And the answer is historically well known: one needs a Demon. …[I]n
order to become a physicalist – to reduce the real world itself to a set of physical events – the physicist needs a God’s-Eye View (Putnam, 1990)…Yet, how can we accept the help of a supernatural entity on the one hand, if on
the other we want to reduce the real world to a set of physical events?
</span>(Soto, Sonnenschein and Miquel, 2008, p. 6)</p>
<p class="indent">Whether one buys the argument or not, if one is to criticize <span class="small-caps">toft</span> authors’ views on causality, this paper is a big piece missing in the discussion. The critics pursue:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  In particular, the advocates of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> do not bring strong arguments showing that the tissues exert an authentic top-down causality on the cells
  <span class="textbf">[See again Soto, Sonnenschein and Miquel (2008)]</span>. On the contrary, we argue that the advocates of <span class="small-caps">toft</span>, including Bizzarri and co-workers, defend a typical
  <span class="cmti-10">physicalist reductionism</span>, despite their explicit criticism of both physicalism <span class="cmti-10">and</span> reductionism: their article refers to biophysical forces
  <span class="textbf">[The expression ‘biophysical forces’ does not exist in the paper]</span> applied to the cells (which is a <span class="textbf">[bio?]</span>physicalist way of thinking). (2016, p. 3, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast this alleged ‘physicalist way of thinking’ with the original paper by Bizzarri and Cucina (who also happen to cite Soto, Sonnenschein and Miquel (2008)):</p>
<p class="indent quote"><span class="cmti-10">Indeed, in the context of complex systems, physical forces and constraints acquire new properties (emergence) that are not anticipated or fixed at the beginning of a process: mechanical force may acquire novel properties, such
as that of inducing gene expression, which cannot be predicted from our knowledge of the physical world.
</span>(Bizzarri and Cucina, 2016, p. 225)</p>
<p class="indent">The critics go on:</p>
<p class="indent quote">
  Besides, they [Bizzarri and Cucina] define reductionism as ‘‘the concept for which every phenomenon can be explained by those universal principles governing the smallest components participating in the observed phenomenon’’
  <span class="textbf">[Bizzarri and Cucina (2016) cite Nagel (1998), which the critics do not indicate]</span>. Yet, the notion of <span class="cmti-10">molecular architecture</span> of the tissues is often used to expose and defend
  <span class="small-caps">toft</span> (Soto and Sonnenschein 2011) <span class="textbf">[The expression ‘molecular architecture’ does not exist in the paper. That of ‘tissue architecture’ does]</span>, and it is hard to justify that
  <span class="small-caps">dna</span> is ‘‘smaller’’ that [sic] the molecules of the extra-cellular matrix. We definitely agree that the general architecture of tissues
  <span class="textbf">[This is not the same as that of the extra-cellular matrix]</span> can have an effect on cell proliferation. But this affirmation does not deny the principle of physical closure; in other words, it is logically
  possible to defend the role of tissues in promoting carcinogenesis in a reductionist frame <span class="textbf">[In TOFT this is logically impossible since tissues are considered irreducible to their parts]</span>. We think the
  assimilation of <span class="small-caps">toft</span> to an anti-reductionist theory is based on a confusion between reductionism, as an ontological frame, and genetic determinism, as a causal mechanism
  <span class="textbf">[It is difficult to see how this conclusion is warranted]</span>. (2016, p. 3, their emphasis)
</p>
<p class="indent">In our conclusion we propose an interpretation of the approximations and misunderstandings exemplified in these passages.</p>
<h2 class="sectionHead" id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2>
<p class="indent">
  Since new paradigms are born from old ones, they ordinarily incorporate much of the vocabulary and apparatus, both conceptual and manipulative, that the traditional paradigm had previously employed. But they seldom employ these
  borrowed elements in quite the traditional way. Within the new paradigm, old terms, concepts, and experiments fall into new relationships one with the other. The inevitable result is what we must call, though the term is not quite
  right, a misunderstanding between the two competing schools. …Only men who had together undergone or failed to undergo that transformation would be able to discover precisely what they agreed or disagreed about. Communication across
  the revolutionary divide is inevitably partial. (Kuhn, 1962, p. 149)
</p>
<p class="indent">
  <span class="cmti-10">Errare humanum est</span>, and we would not pretend to be immune to the same sort of mistakes that we have reviewed here. However, the wealth of errors, deformations and misinterpretations exemplified by the
  critics cannot be the product of chance alone: a biased view must have presided to the redaction of their papers. We suggest this is the <span class="small-caps">smt</span> paradigm. Trapped in the old paradigm, the critics were not
  in a situation to understand <span class="small-caps">toft</span>. Having already crossed the divide (Vallat et al, 2013), we hope to have done better justice to their arguments. As such, the contribution of the critics is valuable
  from a historical point of view, as an illustration of Kuhn’s thesis, written on a page – ironically – sandwiched in between two pages cited by the critics themselves (2016, p. 4-5).
</p>
<p class="indent">
  To us, a theory proposes a perspective on natural phenomena, a way to understand them. Changes of theory are changes of perspective, new ways to look at nature and to make sense of it. Science is a prolific activity and a field can
  host several incompatible theories entertaining rich relationships, as is the case in physics (Batterman, 2001). This means that reductive unification, as desirable as it may seem, is <span class="cmti-10">de facto</span> a
  fiction. Rather than scaffolding on this fiction, we advocate an examination of the mathematical and conceptual flesh of theories. Such an examination should question whether theoretical thinking as we presently know it in physics
  is adequate for biology (Montévil et al, 2016; Miquel, 2011). In any case, we are confident that the challenges of XXIst century biology will require a great deal of genuine invention.

    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn1" id="ftn1">1</a></span><span class="small-caps">Smt</span> doesn’t start neatly with
    two authors and it is possible that the current version be a ‘phantom’ scientific project (Wolfe, 2016), crystallized in reaction to <span class="small-caps">toft</span> (see also Coffman (2005); Soto and Sonnenschein (2005)). We give here
    an account which we deem faithful to the first ‘Hallmarks’ paper (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).
  </p>
  <p class="indent" ><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn3" id="ftn2">2</a></span> See e.g. Nowak, Michor and Iwasa (2003).</p>
  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn3" id="ftn3">3</a></span>To be precise, the ‘Hallmarks’ paper is inconsistent on this
    question: “Normal cells require mitogenic growth signals (GS) <span class="cmti-10">before they can move from a quiescent state</span> into an active proliferative state. …Within a normal tissue, multiple antiproliferative signals
    <span class="cmti-10">operate to maintain cellular quiescence</span> and tissue homeostasis…” (pp. 58-60 Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, our emphasis). In other terms, normal cells need signals both to be quiescent and not to be quiescent.
    A way out of this inconsistency is to consider that there is no defined default state in <span class="small-caps">smt</span>. This latter interpretation shall not affect our argument, since <span class="small-caps">smt</span> would still be
    incompatible with <span class="small-caps">toft</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn4" id="ftn4">4</a></span>   See for example Berenblum and Shubik (1949), Brinster (1974), Pierce et al (1974),
     Kenny and Bissell (2003), Bizzarri et al (2008), Barcellos-Hoff (2010). We thank a reviewer for suggesting these references to us.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn5" id="ftn5">5</a></span>   Technically, organization should be understood here as the mutual dependencies between the parts of an organism, which can
    to an extent be proper to an individual (Montévil and Mossio, 2015). Cancer is then characterized by an increase of morphological complexity and a loss of organization (Longo et al, 2015).
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn6" id="ftn6">6</a></span>Applications of this notion of default state can be found in
    Ginzburg and Colyvan (2004); Soto, Longo, Montévil and Sonnenschein (2016); Montévil, Speroni, Sonnenschein and Soto (2016). Montévil et al. (2016) also discusses the default state used in several mathematical models of mammary gland
    morphogenesis.
  </p>
  <p class="indent"><span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn7" id="ftn7">7</a></span>Another example is in thermodynamics. Thermodynamic phenomena are oriented in the sense that some thermodynamic processes are irreversible. However, the trajectory of every single molecule is reversible in classical mechanics.
Irreversibility is a property of the system and not of the elements. A century of hard mathematical work and the edification of non trivial hypotheses have been necessary to articulate the two levels. [See for example Chibbaro,
Rondoni and Vulpiani (2014), Bitbol (2012), Longo, Montévil and Pocheville (2012), and Longo and Montévil (2014)].</span></p>
  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn8" id="ftn8">8</a></span>Actually, Soto and Sonnenschein advocate that there is a
    coupling between the level of the organism and the level of cells in development (Soto, Sonnenschein and Miquel, 2008).

  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn9" id="ftn9">9</a></span>To be fair, the critics do cite Rosenfeld (2013) for this
    abdication, but Rosenfeld only explains that he does not understand the notion.

  <p class="indent">
    <span class="footnodeNumber"><a class="Footnote_20_Symbol" href="#body_ftn10" id="ftn10">10</a></span>The critics cite what seems to be another version of the same paper
