 <p class="noindent">
   Endocrine
 disruptors alter mammary gland development, impair the ability to 
nourish offspring, and increase the cancer risk in animal models. 
Epidemiological studies reveal trends towards early mammary development,
 nursing problems, and breast cancer in younger women. Morphological 
changes in mouse postnatal mammary gland development are considered 
sensitive markers of endocrine disruption. While the mouse mammary gland
 is easily amenable to morphometric measurements from the fetal stage to
 full maturity, the rat mammary gland grows more conspicuously into the 
third dimension, hindering conventional morphometric analysis. However, 
since rats are more commonly used in international toxicological 
reproductive studies, it would be beneficial to include mammary gland 
whole-mount analysis in these studies. Using our quantitative software 
to perform computer-driven analysis of the rat mammary epithelium we 
examined the effects of gestational and postnatal exposure to 
ketoconazole, an antifungal medication that affects steroidogenesis, and
 to the estrogen diethylstilbestrol in the mammary glands of 6- and 
22-day-old females. Both treatments produced effects at both ages; the 
epithelium was smaller and less complex in exposed animals compared to 
controls. Global analysis with the permutation test showed that 
morphological evaluation of the PND22 mammary gland is sensitive to 
endocrine disruption and possibly non-monotonic. In addition to 
revealing that ketoconazole altered the mammary gland structure, these 
results suggest that for future toxicology studies, day 22 (at weaning) 
is more suitable than day 6 because it showed significant measurements 
and trends. If the collection of mammary glands is added to existing 
international test methods, PND22 could be a relevant time point.

     Endocrine-
disrupting chemicals have been shown to alter mammary gland (MG) 
development, impair the ability to nourish offspring via lactation, 
increase mammary tissue density, and increase the propensity for 
developing cancer in animal models

 These results are consistent with epidemiological studies revealing

 This is evaluated by image analysis of mammary gland whole mounts. 
Additionally, it has been known for almost 40 years that the mouse 
neonatal mammary gland is significantly more sensitive to estrogens than
 the uterus and the vagina

 Thus, it is important to examine the potential of the rodent mammary 
gland as a target for disruption of female reproduction, given that 
several of the currently used tests and endpoints are quite insensitive 
to these chemicals

     .
 It should be noted that the mammary gland is not only sensitive to 
estrogens, progesterone and prolactin but also to additional hormonal 
stimuli including vitamin D, androgens, thyroid hormones, etc.

     in a non-monotonic fashion. This fact further complicates the selection
 of appropriate methodologies for assessing toxicological effects, as a 
single high dose will not suffice if the most striking effects are found
 at low or intermediate doses

      The
 rat is the preferred model for the study of female reproduction and, 
thus, for the internationally applied toxicological test methods 
involving reproductive endpoints. The rat is also considered a good 
model for the study of mammary gland carcinogenesis, particularly for 
those that are hormone-sensitive

 In order to include the mammary gland as an endpoint in these 
toxicological studies, methodologies need to be adjusted to work in rat 
tissue. One reason for this is that while the mouse mammary gland ductal
 tree is easy to analyze by standard morphometric methods, the rat 
mammary gland grows conspicuously into the third dimension, hindering 
the application of conventional morphometrics (

     To overcome this limitation, a new quantitative semi-automatic methodology was developed

 This method is used to obtain truly quantitative data, which is 
expected to validate the semiquantitative methods that are already 
available. Both methods have the advantage of providing a global 
evaluation of effects, rather than a single endpoint. In order to 
evaluate the morphological changes in the mammary gland, the shape of 
the entire gland is assessed, as well as individual characteristics of 
the epithelial structures. One way to accomplish this is by using the 
imaging processing program Image J (

 A methodology that results in over a hundred measurements per rat in an
 experiment where the animal number per group is one order of magnitude 
lower requires specific statistics, particularly when a substantial 
number of the variables that describe the mammary gland are not 
independent, and it is necessary to assess dose-response. Therefore, the
 statistical analysis has to assess the results globally; to this end, 
we use the permutation test, which is a robust method commonly used in 
other fields (the rationale for this approach is developed in the 
methods section).

 as well as to assess the sensitivity of the rat mammary gland to proven
 model endocrine disruptors and to compare it with the traditional 
reproductive endpoints measured in the same animals. In this study, two 
time points were assessed, postnatal day (PND) 6 and PND22. The two ages
 allow for analysis before and after the ovaries begin secreting 
hormones. Additionally, the quantitative automatic methodology developed
 by Montévil, Acevedo et al.

either one of two endocrine disruptors known to produce effects in 
humans, the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) and the 
fungicide Ketoconazole (KETO) from gestational day (GD) 7 until PND22. 
While DES is a full estrogen agonist that acts via the nuclear estrogen 
receptors alpha and beta, KETO alters steroid hormone synthesis in 
humans and rodents by inhibiting various cytochrome P450 enzymes of the 
steroidogenesis pathway, interfering with both androgen and estrogen 
synthesis

 This paradoxical result may be due to the inhibition of the

1.25 µm for the PND6 and 2.5 µm for the PND22. Tiles were stitched

 Examples of some assessed quantities are the aspect ratio 
(length/width), the epithelial area, and the fractal dimension of the 
epithelium in 2D (the projection of its 3D image). The same kind of 
global analysis was also performed in 3D and included an evaluation of 
the surface of the epithelium, its volume, and its 3D fractal dimension 
(based on the box-counting method). The skeletonized epithelium was 
analyzed by generic methods (counting the number of branches, average 
branch length, etc.). This analysis was performed both with and without 
terminal branches (pruning) since some of the terminal branches may not 
correspond to actual epithelial structures but may be artifacts from the
 skeletonization process. The number of parts categorized as buds by 
machine learning in the segmentation step and total bud volume were also
 counted. It should be noted that these structures are identified as 
buds by the software but may include very short branches.

 This plugin uses the skeleton generated for previous endpoints and adds
 a manual selection of the starting point of the gland (the point of 
attachment to the skin). The plugin then reconstructs the mammary tree 
with the main duct as the root. This reconstruction was used as the 
basis for evaluating various properties. When quantities are defined per
 branch, the average of all branches is reported. To filter biologically
 relevant shapes, two versions of these quantities were reported: one 
where branches smaller than 5 µm were excluded and another where 
branches smaller than 15 µm (2.5 µm and 7.5 µm for PND6) were excluded 
removing insignificant structures or artifacts. Some examples of the 
quantities reported from this analysis are the length of branches and 
the distance from a branch to the point of attachment, counted both in 
terms of the number of branching points and as the sum of the lengths of
 the branches that linked the two. Branching angles and the tortuosity 
of the branches (i.e., for a branch, the ratio between its length by the
 length of a straight line between its extremities: the less straight 
the branch, the higher the tortuosity) were also considered. Other 
quantities, such as the local thickness, both in 2D and 3D, were also 
determined by considering the average and standard deviation of their 
values on the skeleton points of every branch.

       2.7.1. The rationale for the statistical analysis
      </h4>
      <p class="noindent" id="p0120">
       In
 this study design, there are 10–11 animals per treatment with three 
doses each of two chemicals as well as the control animals. Unlike more 
customary animal studies in which each individual animal yields a 
limited number of measurements for a small set of endpoints, this work 
generates measurements for 139 endpoints for the mammary gland of each 
individual rat. In this experimental design, there are circumstances 
that may interfere with a typical statistical analysis. First, in many 
cases, single features and specific doses will not be statistically 
significant alone because variability is naturally high due to the fact 
that animals are individuals
       <a class="anchor anchor-primary" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="bib26" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="#bib26" name="bbib26">

 and generic corrections of multiple comparisons cripple statistical 
significance. Second, the recurrence of a typical linear pattern could 
very well stem from a common, random origin since different features of 
an animal can be correlated

 therefore, a more adequate statistical method for such analyses is 
required. To build on the diversity of features measured and to avoid 
errors stemming from multiple comparisons of non-independent variables, 
an analysis was designed at the level of all observed features combined 
with the relevant treatments (for example, the three doses of KETO). 
This strategy was tested and utilized in our previous work

       In this study, the different features observed for an animal are not independent

       – for example, the total length of the epithelial branches and their 
volume are correlated. Also, when working with endocrine disrupting 
compounds, a linear response is not the only dose-response expected. The
 complex structure of this analysis necessitates the use of statistics 
more commonly associated with -omics datasets, such as those used in 
transcriptomics or metabolomics

 In the current study, we again use the Monte Carlo permutation test and
 the principal component analysis (PCA) for a more global analysis of 
the data. Unlike traditional tests, which use a standard distribution, 
the permutation test builds the statistic based on the data and a 
specific statistical hypothesis. Because DES is an estrogen and KETO 
affects the synthesis of estrogens, additional statistical tests are run
 to ascertain whether their effects in the mammary gland are similar.

       2.7.2. Permutation test
      </h4>
      <p class="noindent" id="p0130">
       Like
 any statistical test, the permutation test requires a null hypothesis 
and an alternative hypothesis that, in the observed data, a random 
variable (X) would reach a value that is too far from its expected mean 
under the null hypothesis to be probable, with a threshold of p = 0.05.
      </p>
      <p class="noindent" id="p0135">
       The
 Monte Carlo permutation test is performed using the null hypothesis 
that all experimental samples follow the same distribution. The first 
step is to define and compute the random variable (X) on the observed 
data. The second step is to pool all sample data and resample them, 
maintaining the group size for each treatment. This operation of 
permutation is equivalent to randomly assigning the condition (exposure)
 of each animal but holding the number of animals for every condition 
constant and, for each individual animal, preserving all its measured 
biological properties. Since all variables describing individual animals
 except their condition (exposure dose) are left unchanged, all 
correlations between the morphological features in data sets are 
preserved in the permutations and considered in the test. Moreover, 
under the null hypothesis that the treatment is inconsequential, this 
permutation of the treatment labels preserves the statistical properties
 of the data. The third step is to compute the value of X on the 
permuted data. Step four is to iterate steps two and three a given 
number of times (10,000 in our case). Step five is to regroup the 
results of step four to obtain the distribution of X under the null 
hypothesis, and then to assess whether X observed in the original data, 
computed in step 1, is in the 95 % confidence range around the mean of 
X. If X observed is outside this range, the null hypothesis is rejected 
in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This analysis has also been 
further described in Montévil et al.

        To
 expand on the above result, the effect of the highest dose of DES was 
assessed for consistency with the KETO trend. To this end, the 
permutation test was used in two different ways, that is, for two 
different random variables. The first counted the number of endpoints 
which show a linear trend for KETO and for which the difference between 
the mean of control and DES 0.012 and the mean of control and KETO 12 
have the same sign i.e., same trend or direction,

 Secondly, since the prevalence of linearity may complicate the 
interpretation of the above, the permutation test was then restricted to
 only those endpoints that previously displayed a linear response for 
KETO. In this second case, the random variable was defined as the number
 of endpoints for which the difference between the mean of control and 
DES 0.012 and the mean of control and KETO 12 have the same sign (i.e., 
same trend), and this difference has a threshold p-value lower than 0.5

 number of doses tested in this dataset is insufficient to directly 
ascertain the presence of non-monotonic dose responses. However, there 
is an indirect way to do this, namely by examining the effects of the 
doses with respect to the control value

 For example, if a low dose of KETO and a high dose of KETO have a 
consistent (same sign) or opposite effect (opposite sign) compared to 
the control. In the case of an opposite effect, the effect would be due 
to a non-monotonic relationship between dose and effect. To this end, we
 used the same random variables as in 2.7.2.ii, looking instead at the 
difference between the mean of control and KETO 3 and the mean of

is, all but two variables among the 43 show a similar effect at the

significant for markers of complexity but not for size, and only at the 
lowest doses (

     The
 objectives of this study were to assess the effect of the endocrine 
disruptors KETO and DES in the developing mammary gland and to compare 
the sensitivity of the rat mammary gland with traditional reproductive 
endpoints measured in the same set of animals at the two time points 
(PND6 and PND22). Mammary development is studied using the quantitative 
automatic methodology we recently developed

     , we observed that this fungicide affects mammary gland development.

     PND22
 showed a much larger number of significant endpoints affected than 
PND6. This difference is consistent with the interpretation that the 
initial effect of KETO and DES is magnified by exposure to endogenous 
ovarian estrogens, which start to be secreted around PND12
     <a class="anchor anchor-primary" data-sd-ui-side-panel-opener="true" data-xocs-content-id="bib25" data-xocs-content-type="reference" href="#bib25" name="bbib25">

     </a>
     .
 However, although the number of significant parameters is lower in PND6
 than in PND22, the differences at PND6 manifest at the lowest dose 
tested for both DES and KETO, suggesting that the rat mammary gland is 
more sensitive at a younger age. The scarcity of significant endpoints 
at the lowest dose in PND22 could possibly be due to the presence of 
endogenous estrogens at this age which might decrease the differences 
between controls and treated animals.
    </p>
    <p class="noindent" id="p0235">
     One
 challenge when using a 2D projection of the image of the mammary gland 
results from the structure of the ductal tree, which is growing in the 
three dimensions of space. This fact limits the analysis of the rat 
mammary gland to ages equal to or younger than PND22 using confocal 
microscopy. Indeed, the thickness of the MG at PND6 and PND22 allowed 
for the collection of confocal images and a complete 3D reconstruction, 
although this process did prove time-consuming. This, in turn, allowed 
for the precise measurements which constitute the major contribution of 
this work. In contrast, the increased thickness of the gland after PND22
 precludes the inclusion of later time points in this precise analysis.
    </p>
    <p class="noindent" id="p0240">
     A
 linear dose-response curve to KETO (the 3 doses excluding the control, 
ANOVA p < 0.05) was found in 43 variables. The probability that at 
least 43 variables would randomly display this pattern was negated by 
the permutation test result of a p = 0.028 thus suggesting a strong 
likelihood that the effect is due to the treatment. The current study 
design with only 3 doses per treatment did not allow for the direct 
assessment of non-monotonicity, the original motivation for the 
development of this methodology, since the semi-quantitative ones are 
not as well suited for this purpose, particularly when the specimens are
 evaluated in reference to both a positive and negative control

     As
 stated above, several of these variables indicate that the gland size 
and complexity are decreased by increased KETO doses at the later 
timepoint; some measurements are significant at the 2 highest doses of 
KETO. The highest dose of DES also had an effect comparable to that of 
the highest dose of KETO. The relevant issue is not the magnitude of the
 effect, but its direction, i.e., if KETO decreases the variable, so 
does DES, as indicated in

 This phenomenon holds true for 41 of the 43 variables with p = 0.032 by
 a permutation test. This result corroborates the trend observed with 
KETO in different animals. The average branch length increased; this 
means that the branches bifurcate at a lower frequency than in the 
control; this applies both to DES and KETO. Additionally, at the highest
 doses tested, both DES and KETO exposure decreased bud number; this is 
consistent with decreased formation of branches and alveolar structures.
 Although the 3 doses of DES and of KETO showed directionality as 
expected in a monotonic dose response curve, a nonmonotonic dose 
response curve cannot be ruled out as only the control and 3 doses of 
each chemical were tested. Regarding KETO, the lowest dose tended to 
have the opposite effect as that of the highest dose when compared to 
the control (

 the highest DES dose caused slightly longer anogenital distance, while 
the 3 DES doses showed a slight delay in the vaginal opening, as did the
 intermediate KETO dose. Another part of the study investigated the 
effects of DES and KETO on the hypothalamic control of puberty in female
 rats. The results showed a delay in the maturation of 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion before puberty by a 
decreased pulsatility of GnRH secretion, a result consistent with delays
 in the vaginal opening. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a high 
number of genes regulating the activity of the extrinsic GnRH pulse 
generator were consistently affected by all the doses of DES and KETO 
before puberty

 The study on hypothalamic control of puberty suggested potential 
biomarkers for assessing the effects of such chemicals on reproductive 
health. These could, together with the assessment of mammary glands, be 
included in future testing strategies for EDC identification.

     5. Conclusions
    </h2>
    <p class="noindent" id="p0260">
     These
 results show that, as inferred, ketoconazole affects the development of
 the mammary gland parenchyma. The mammary gland is sensitive to the 
doses of DES and KETO tested in this experiment, with several variables 
indicating that the gland parenchyma size is decreased, and the ductal 
system is less complex. This agrees with the findings of delayed 
pubertal onset and delay in GnRH pulsatility in animals from the same 
study. The consistent, gradual decline in measurements across the three 
KETO doses indicates a clear directionality, highlighting the robustness
 of the endpoint being affected at two out of the three doses tested.
    </p>
    <p class="noindent" id="p0265">
     These
 results support the potential inclusion of the PND22 (weanling) mammary
 gland whole mounts in future international test methods for 
reproductive toxicity.
    </p>
    <p class="noindent" id="p0270">
     While
 advanced mammary morphology studies using 3D scans are unlikely to 
become standard requirements in regulatory toxicology studies in the 
near future, our results demonstrate the potential for identifying key 
endpoints. These findings suggest that further exploration and 
improvement of simpler quantitative image analysis methods could be 
beneficial.
    </p>
    <p class="noindent" id="p0275">
     Moreover, the
 permutation test is a versatile and straightforward tool that may be 
used to assess specific trends in complex data, such as dose responses, 
even when there are fewer endpoints than in this study.
