Abstract
</h3>
     <!-- l. 44 --><p class='noindent'>Physics has several concepts of randomness that build on the idea that the possibilities
     are pre-given. By contrast, an increasing number of theoretical biologists attempt to
     introduce new possibilities, that is to say, changes of possibility space – an idea already
     discussed by Bergson and that was not genuinely pursued scientifically until recently
     (except, in a sense, in systematics, i.e, the method to classify living beings).
     </p><!-- l. 46 --><p class='indent'>   Then, randomness operates at the level of possibilities themselves and is the basis
     of the historicity of biological objects. We emphasize that this concept of randomness
     is not only relevant when aiming to predict the future. Instead, it shapes biological
     organizations and ecosystems. As an illustration, we argue that a critical issue of the
     Anthropocene is the disruption of the biological organizations that natural history has
     shaped, leading to a collapse of biological possibilities.

<!-- l. 51 --><p class='noindent'>This chapter discusses how randomness became a pillar of biology and how its precise
conceptualization remains a challenge for current theoretical biology, with applications to the
stakes of our time, commonly called the Anthropocene. Now randomness is a complex notion in
the sciences, and it is necessary for our discussion to go back briefly on its history outside
biology.
</p><!-- l. 53 --><p class='indent'>   Randomness is at the crossroad of different questions. First comes causality and, in a sense, a
random phenomenon is not entailed by causes. Second comes betting, with money games
and insurances (historically, for the trading boats during colonization) — and here
computations are critical. Probability theories were developed precisely to provide metrics
to randomness. Last comes the notion of unpredictability, and it is the most recent
one.
</p><!-- l. 55 --><p class='indent'>   In sciences, these different questions combine ... in almost every possible way. For example,
so-called chaotic dynamics are deterministic, thus devoid of "causal randomness" but
unpredictable. Why? These peculiar situations are due to two combining reasons. First,
measurement in classical mechanics is never perfect; we assess an object’s position and velocity up
to a certain precision – this is a matter of principles, not of technology. Second, however close
initial conditions are, the subsequent trajectories will diverge very quickly (exponentially fast).
Combining these two factors implies unpredictability; small causes, even the ones we cannot
measure, can have significant effects. This situation is the so-called butterfly effect, the idea that a
                                                                            
                                                                            
butterfly flapping its wings can create a hurricane elsewhere. It is also why we cannot tell
whether the solar system is stable or whether a planet will be ejected from it at some
point.
</p><!-- l. 57 --><p class='indent'>   Let us examine another mismatch. In computer sciences, a computer is deterministic and
predictable; as Turing calls it, it is a discrete state machine where access to the state can be
perfect. However, randomness appears when we put different theoretical computers together
(including the different cores in current computers) because there is no certainty on which
computation will be faster. This randomness corresponds indeed to unpredictability, but its
peculiarity is that it does not have a metric (there are no probabilities). Let us give a picturesque
example of this. Imagine the simulation of wind acting on the roof so that roof tiles fall.
Imagine also the simulation of the walk of a pedestrian. Then, if different cores perform
these two simulations, the roof tile may or may not fall on the pedestrian because the
update of both models is not synchronized (if it is poorly designed). Then, computer
scientists typically design their algorithm so that it leads to the intended results in all
situations.
</p><!-- l. 59 --><p class='indent'>   Nevertheless, in a sense, randomness always goes with unpredictability. But, the relationship
between the two different notions is not entirely straightforward. For example, the random
motion of molecules leads a delicious smell to propagate in a kitchen and beyond. In
general, when we study a gas, as Boltzmann puts it, the molecular chaos leads the gas
to tend to the situation of maximum entropy, which is perfectly predictable. Along
the same line, pure probabilistic randomness is not the most unpredictable situation.
For example, the heads or tails game statistics are very well known, and we can make
predictions for a large number of throws. probabilities are deeply distinct from anomia,
the absence of norms or laws. it is the same in the case of quantum mechanics, where
possibilities and probabilities are very well defined. By contrast, the ability of polls
in an election to predict outcomes is limited at best. One reason for this is that the
citizens and localities are diverse, and the ability of polls to sample this diversity is
limited. Moreover, they change over time and influence each other, making the situation
even more complicated. Meteorology is somewhat similar because these phenomena
would be easier to predict, at least statistically, if they displayed the coin’s elementary
randomness.
</p><!-- l. 62 --><p class='indent'>   Now, let us examine the notion of causation briefly since it is a way to address randomness. Of
course, the question of causation has a long history that we do not aim to unfold. Let us mention
that the term used by Aristotle (aition) and the Latin (causa) have their roots in legal vocabulary.
Like responsibility, causes are ways to understand why something happens and what objects are
involved in it happening. Over time, the perspective changed significantly. With Leibniz,
Descartes, and Galileo, causation was made explicit by mathematics, and these mathematics were
endowed with theological meaning. In this sense, there was no room for randomness w.r.
causation.
</p><!-- l. 64 --><p class='indent'>   Along this line, Einstein later said that "God does not play dice". The shadow of theology still
lingers significantly on physics and philosophy (and nowadays on computer sciences); on the other
side, a purely utilitarian, typically computational view of science emerges where understanding
does not matter genuinely anymore ( Anderson, <a href='#cite.0@anderson2008end'>2008</a>). Between Charybdis and Scilla,
we argue that science lies where theoretical work is performed (among other things).
Theories are not merely a description of nature; they embed various considerations,
mathematical, empirical, epistemological, and methodological ( Montévil, <a href='#cite.0@2021-Montevil-episteme-computational-empiricism'>2021</a>). Theorization,
then, is the best effort to make sense scientifically of the world (at least of a category of
phenomena). Of course, then, another reading on causation is possible, causation is
relative to a theory, and it describes what happens when something happens — while the
theory posits what is taking place when nothing happens, like in the in the principle of
inertia.
</p><!-- l. 67 --><p class='indent'>   Following this line, the theory defines randomness w.r. to causation, if any. Classical mechanics
does not allow it (due to the Cauchy-Lipshitz theorem that states that forces do determine
trajectories), while quantum mechanics has a specific form of randomness associated with
measurement. Overall we call structure of determination what a theory says about
phenomena and their relation (and this structure can be deterministic or random in diverse
ways).
</p><!-- l. 69 --><p class='indent'>   Now theories are not relevant only to randomness w.r. to causation. First, an almost entirely
empirical approach may assess probabilities, like in financial trading. However, there is always the
possibility that the phenomena depart strongly from those. By contrast, probabilities may stem
from a theory, in which case they come with an understanding of the phenomena and are more
                                                                            
                                                                            
robust, we will come back to this point. Second, negative results, like unpredictability, are
notoriously difficult to prove. To prove that something is impossible, we need to have a precise way
to talk about what is possible — otherwise, unpredictability may be only a property of a
particular approach and vanish in another. Again, theories are then the proper level where
unpredictability may be grounded.
</p><!-- l. 75 -->
   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='how-randomness-came-to-originate-current-living-beings'><span class='titlemark'>2   </span> How randomness came to originate current living beings</h3>
<!-- l. 77 --><p class='noindent'>A primary question in the study of living beings is how we should understand that the parts of an
animal, an organism, or an ecosystem seem to fit so well together. In natural theology, the order of
the living world resulted from a divine creator. Theology was used to explain why living beings
exist even though their organizations and arrangements in the “economy of nature” do not seem to
result from chance alone. For example, J. Biberg, a disciple of Linneus, stated that “economy of
nature means the very wise disposition of natural beings, instituted by the sovereign creator,
according to which they tend to common ends and have reciprocal functions” ( Biberg, <a href='#cite.0@bilberg'>1749</a>, p. 1).
Along the same line, William Paley, one of the last proponents of natural theology, famously
compared a stone and a watch. We can understand the stone by stating that it has always
been the same; however, in the case of the watch, the parts depend on each other to
meet an end, and this arrangement needs to be explained by a watchmaker – and for
the living, God would be the explanation ( Paley, <a href='#cite.0@Paley'>1802</a>). Kant’s critical position leads
to more modest claims; for him, the relationship between the parts and the organism
cannot be addressed by pure reason. Instead, it requires a natural purpose, and the
latter is a matter of judgment ( Kant, <a href='#cite.0@KantCritique'>1790</a>). However, Kant’s perspective only really
accommodates the functioning of organisms, and the subsequent teleomechanist tradition focused
on these questions, in modern terms, physiology and development ( Huneman, <a href='#cite.0@huneman2007understanding'>2007</a>).
However, this tradition does not address how these biological organizations came to
be.
</p><!-- l. 80 --><p class='indent'>   As an alternative to natural theology, Lamarck, among others, developed a transformist view of
biology. In a sense, his perspective is primarily deterministic; characters are transformed when
performing activities and are inherited by the next generation. Nevertheless, in his
view, diversification results from the changing circumstances living beings meet. In this
sense, randomness originates biological diversity, provided that a classical concept of
randomness is the confluence of independent causal chains, we will come back to this
point.
</p><!-- l. 82 --><p class='indent'>   Darwin introduced a new rationale by building on artificial selection. Concerning the latter, he
states, “nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to
him. In this sense, he may be said to make for himself useful breeds” ( Darwin, <a href='#cite.0@darwin1859origin'>1859</a>).
Heritable variations appear in the wild, and some of these are preserved because they
lead to favorable consequences. Over time, “endless forms most beautiful and most
wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” At each step, variation appears while natural
selection is only about the preservation of some of them, as emphasized by part of the
subtitle of the <span class='ecti-1000'>Origin of species</span>: “the <span class='ecti-1000'>preservation </span>of favored races in evolution” (we
emphasize, following  Lecointre (<a href='#cite.0@doi:10.1002/9781119452713.ch14'>2018</a>)). However, the nature of these variations and the
corresponding randomness (Darwin refers to it as chance) are only loosely specified
despite Darwin’s best efforts to synthesize the literature available at the time of his
writing.
</p><!-- l. 85 --><p class='indent'>   Let us stress three points concerning Darwin’s view. First, some variations appear irrespective
of their consequences on the reproductive success of organisms, thus of their possible functional
role. In contrast with characters acquired by sustaining an activity, this disconnection
meets the classical notion of randomness mentioned above, albeit at a different level.
Second, Darwin cares deeply about possible laws of variation, and his sketch on the topic
hints at a research program that is far less reductionist than the work of many of his
successors. For example, he emphasizes correlated variations, which only make sense at
the level of organisms. Last, Darwin’s insights are not limited to natural selection. He
systematized the concept that biological objects are part of a historical process: evolution.
Then he suggested classifying living beings based on their genealogy, an idea that only
came to fruition in the second part of the XXth century ( Lecointre &amp; Le Guyader,
<a href='#cite.0@lecointre2006tree'>2006</a>).
                                                                            
                                                                            
</p><!-- l. 88 --><p class='indent'>   Genetics and the molecular biology revolution introduced a specification for Darwin’s
randomness as DNA mutations, while the organisms themselves were considered in
deterministic terms (Monod, <a href='#cite.0@Monod'>1970</a>) – loosely imported from computer sciences ( Longo,
Miquel, et al., <a href='#cite.0@longo2012'>2012</a> ; Walsh, <a href='#cite.0@doi:10.1080/03080188.2020.1795803'>2020</a>). Then variation follows from randomness specified as a
molecular process, according to the probabilistic nature of the processes described by
thermochemistry, for example. Here, the randomness of variations stems not only from
independent causal lines that meet but also from molecular disorder, in the sense of Boltzmann.
Mutations change DNA randomly, leading to phenotypic variations determined by the new
“program”. However, the connection between DNA and phenotype was and remains
poorly defined; the concept of computer program remains merely an <span class='ecti-1000'>ad hoc </span>metaphor to
state that DNA determines the phenotype and, thus, that research should focus on how
causality goes from DNA to the phenotype. In the practice of molecular biology, thus, at
the level of organisms, DNA would act somewhat like Aristotle’s unmoved mover, but
at the level of forms, thus enforcing norms stemming from history (defining a kind of
teleonomy).
</p><!-- l. 90 --><p class='indent'>   Let us emphasize that, concerning variations, Darwin’s perspective cares mainly about the
properties of living beings, such as their form or behaviors. By contrast, classical genetics only
makes explicit the structure of heredity among preexisting heritable variants, and, in molecular
biology, mutations are only about changes in DNA sequences that may be somewhat
directly related to changes in proteins. This description is very far from full-fledged
phenotypes. Biologists typically bridge this gap by empirical observation (a change in a DNA
sequence is associated with a change in observed phenotype). When writing models, like in
population genetics, they assume a mathematical relationship by which genotypes determine
phenotypes.
</p><!-- l. 92 --><p class='indent'>   In other words, modern synthesis and molecular biology contributed considerably to biology by
emphasizing critical components of biological heredity and, specifically, heritable variations;
however, it certainly did not provide a theoretical framework to understand biological variations
and thus the chances that natural selection can operate upon. In particular, the notion of DNA
mutations does not entail the possibility of open-ended evolution. As an illustration, the properties
of molecular mutations are straightforward to simulate with a computer; however, simulating
something like open-ended evolution is an open challenge for computer scientists ( Soros &amp;
Stanley, <a href='#cite.0@soros2014identifying'>2014</a>).
</p><!-- l. 94 --><p class='indent'>   Let us take the example of theoretical population genetics to clarify the relationship between
natural selection and variation. In this field, variants are defined by their genotypes, and modelers
postulate a mathematical relationship between variants and their fitness, i.e., their statistical
number of offspring reaching reproduction. These models’ most basic epistemic aim is to show that
natural selection indeed leads to the spread of the genes in the population, leading to
more offspring, thus establishing favorable characters that random, heritable variations
provide. However, we emphasize that the phenotypic variations corresponding to the
different alleles are postulated. In typical situations, their description is limited to their
consequences on fitness, so the same model applies to teeth shapes or a digestive enzyme, for
example. Natural selection is primarily, as we emphasized, about the preservation of some
variants.
</p><!-- l. 96 --><p class='indent'>   Nevertheless, these models can lead to optimizing a character for a preexisting function when
considered over time. For example, if a character has some quantitative property that may be
optimized, such as the size of teeth, then iterations of variation and selection can bring about this
singular configuration. Such processes are local since this "creative" role of natural selection only
operates for functions and forms whose property is assumed to be pre-defined and are already
<span class='ecti-1000'>actual</span>. Indeed, natural selection operates in a specific direction for some genes only
once their variations have consequences on a specific function, thus impacting viability.
Here, we find the deep connection between mathematical optimization and <span class='ecti-1000'>telos </span>— a
connection that, incidentally, today’s digital platforms harness when designing algorithms to
fulfill their ends. When Dawkins illustrates natural selection with a toy model, the issue
appears again: he postulates an optimal configuration and shows that the population
converges to it. Then he takes a distance from this model, arguing that “life isn’t like
that”; however, he does not provide a better scheme, where the distant target would not
preexist <span class='ecti-1000'>as a target </span>in the model ( Dawkins, <a href='#cite.0@dawkins1986blind'>1986</a>, p. 60). We can then conclude that
natural selection is about preserving and optimizing preexisting functions, not their
appearance.
</p><!-- l. 98 --><p class='indent'>   In other words, the neo-Darwinian scheme understands evolution as an accumulation of
variations stemming from genetic randomness (random mutations); however, it does not provide
                                                                            
                                                                            
an accurate theoretical account of the organizational aspect of these variations. Therefore, a
precise concept to address biological variations and the associated randomness is still missing. This
chapter compares the biological situation with concepts of randomness in physics and emphasizes
the originality of biology’s theoretical and epistemological challenges. To illustrate the practical
ramification of this perspective, we sketch a new method to predict some variations. Last, we
analyze how organizations actively sustain biological possibilities and how their disruption leads to
them collapsing.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='towards-randomness-as-new-possibilities'><span class='titlemark'>3   </span> Towards randomness as new possibilities</h3>
<!-- l. 102 --><p class='noindent'>Let us first introduce some remarks on randomness in physics before going back to
biology. Randomness may be defined as unpredictability in the intended theory ( Longo &amp;
Montévil, <a href='#cite.0@longo2014'>2018</a>). A characteristic of physics is that its theories, models, and overall
epistemology assumes pre-defined possibilities. It follows that randomness is about the state
of objects, that is to say, about their positions in the abstract space of pre-defined
possibilities. While deterministic frameworks need to singularize the trajectory that
an object follows mathematically, particularly its future states, random frameworks
posit a symmetry between different states so that they can equally or commensurably
occur.
</p><!-- l. 104 --><p class='indent'>   In the simple example of the dice, the possibilities are given by the dice facets, which are
assumed to be symmetric – provided the dice are fair. Of course, in this example, the symmetry is
not just about the dice’s properties; it also corresponds to the dynamic of the throw. The
latter is sensitive enough to details so that the outcome cannot be predicted by the
players (or physicists), and the rotations of the dice establish the equivalence between its
facets (only to an extent, see  Kapitaniak et al., <a href='#cite.0@doi:10.1063/1.4746038'>2012</a>). Notably, other possibilities like
broken dice are typically excluded from probabilistic discussions. Physicists do not forget
this possibility; however, it is not equivalent to the others and rare, and its frequency
depends on changing circumstances; therefore, it is not straightforward to accommodate
it.
</p><!-- l. 106 --><p class='indent'>   Physicists have introduced several concepts of randomness (see Longo &amp; Montévil, <a href='#cite.0@longo2014'>2018</a>, for
an overview). Despite their diversity, they all build on the rationale discussed above, namely some
form of symmetry between different pre-defined possibilities. By this symmetry, they define a
metric for randomness, called probabilities, that determine the expected statistics of the
phenomenon of interest when it can be iterated. In Kolmogorov, the current usual theory of
probabilities, and in quantum frameworks, an event is breaking this symmetry to entail
a particular outcome. It is significant that such random events "add" something to
the mathematical description of a phenomenon, the singularization of one outcome
among several possibilities. In this sense, there is a connection between randomness and
novelty.
</p><!-- l. 110 --><p class='indent'>   The account of biological randomness as molecular-level mutation follows physics (or dice
games) straightforwardly. At first sight, a nucleotide substitution seems to be a random chemical
process with set probabilities. However, even at this molecular level, the theoretical situation
is not that simple. The frequency of mutations depends on correcting enzymes and
their contextual inhibition due to evolutionary processes ( Tenaillon et al., <a href='#cite.0@TENAILLON200111'>2001</a>). In
other words, biological symmetries are not robust and, accordingly, probabilities are
contextual.
</p><!-- l. 115 --><p class='indent'>   As emphasized in the introduction, the heart of biological randomness is the definition of
variations beyond the molecular aspects of mutations. To this end, let us introduce our perspective
on theoretical biology. Unlike in the theories of physics, biology is primarily about historical
objects. In particular, we argue, with others, that a proper theoretical framework for biology,
and singularly biological variations, should accommodate changing possibility spaces (
Gatti et al., <a href='#cite.0@CAZZOLLAGATTI2018110'>2018</a> ; Loreto et al.,
<a href='#cite.0@Loreto2016'>2016</a>). Let us note that changing possibilities here does not just mean adding “more of
the same”; instead, it means possibilities endowed with different properties and, thus,
relationships.
</p><!-- l. 119 --><p class='indent'>   Even though it is reasonably straightforward to implement this kind of scheme mathematically
and computationally ( Adams et al., <a href='#cite.0@unbounded'>2017</a>), it is not the same problem to implement it
theoretically and epistemologically. Indeed, the theoretical method of physics is firstly to postulate
                                                                            
                                                                            
was is possible and then determine what is going to happen. This feature goes with its
hypothetical-deductive structure. Then, in physics, the validity of the assumptions concerning the
possibility space is justified by predicting some aspects of the intended phenomenon theoretically
and empirically. Mathematical models aiming to introduce new possibilities typically fall back to
the physics method by making these new possibilities explicit before they become actual in the
model. In this sense, modelers assume that new possibilities preexist as virtuality before they
appear or, in epistemological terms, that the new possibilities can be known before they
have any kind of actuality, and they do so for methodological reasons. However, from
the perspective of the actual phenomena of interest, these assumptions are entirely
arbitrary, and the models remain speculative toy models for the same methodological
reason.
</p><!-- l. 121 --><p class='indent'>   A new epistemology is required to overcome this deadlock. In my work, I argue that instead
of explaining changes by invariance, like in physics, biology requires to posit change first and then
to explain <span class='ecti-1000'>local </span>invariance. My group calls such local invariants <span class='ecti-1000'>constraints </span>and reworked autopoiesis,
Rosen’s <span class='cmr-10'>(</span><span class='cmmi-10'>M,R</span><span class='cmr-10'>) </span>systems, and Kauffman’s work-constraints cycles as the closure of constraints,
whereby constraints of an organism mutually contribute to sustaining each other by canalyzing
processes of transformation ( Montévil &amp; Mossio, <a href='#cite.0@Montevil2015c'>2015</a>). However, constraints play another kind
of causal role since they also <span class='ecti-1000'>enable </span>the appearance of new constraints ( Longo, Montévil, &amp;
Kauffman, <a href='#cite.0@longo2012b'>2012</a>). For example, articulated jaws enabled teeth of all kinds. Enablement goes with a
strong kind of unpredictability and thus of randomness since it is the very nature of what can
appear that is not only unknowable but unprestatable; that is to say, we cannot list
what is possible.
</p><!-- l. 123 --><p class='indent'>   Nevertheless, we argue that enablement is part of the causal <span class='ecti-1000'>genra </span>and characteristic of truly
historical processes. Enablement may seem mostly a negative concept; however, negative results in
mathematics or natural sciences often open new theoretical paths when we choose to build on
them instead of maintaining current approaches by denial ( Longo, <a href='#cite.0@Longo2019'>2019</a>). Firstly, enablement
can be studied retrospectively. For instance, the phylogenetic classification of living
beings builds on the past emergence of novelties, Specifically shared novelties, to assess
genealogies ( Lecointre &amp; Le Guyader, <a href='#cite.0@lecointre2006tree'>2006</a>). Second, it raises the question of what we can
predict about these new possibilities and in what sense of predicting? The idea that
new constraints are overall unprestatable does not mean that none of them may be
pre-stated. For that, new methods should be designed with an appropriate and controlled
epistemology.

   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='a-new-method-building-on-biological-variations'><span class='titlemark'>4   </span> A new method building on biological variations</h3>
<!-- l. 127 --><p class='noindent'>Let us give an example of a method we are developing along this line. This method deconstructs
mathematical models; it is somewhat reminiscent of deconstruction in Heidegger and Derrida’s
work; however, its stakes are very different. The idea is to consider a model or a mathematical
structure that is biologically relevant and deconstruct it, hypothesis by hypothesis, by
investigating at each step the possible biological meaning of the negation of the considered
hypothesis. From a theoretical perspective, the regularities enabling us to define a mathematical
model are constraints, and they can change, following what we have called the principle of
variation ( Montévil et al., <a href='#cite.0@chaptervariation'>2016</a>). By deconstructing the mathematical object, we explore some of
these variations — the ones that do not require additional assumptions. These variations may be
met in different, more or less closely related species or due to variability in the same
species.
</p><!-- l. 129 --><p class='indent'>   Let us give a simple example of the approach to deconstructing a biologically relevant
mathematical structure and, more precisely, a mathematical form used to describe anatomical
features. The epithelial structure of rat mammary glands is generally described mathematically as
a tree (mathematically axiomatized as an acyclic and connex graph). The negation of the
hypotheses constructing the mathematical tree structure leads to:

<!-- l. 150 --><p class='indent'>   In the context of a single experiment, we have empirical evidence showing the biological relevance of all predictions of deconstruction but one.

In each case, the
variations have consequences for using the tree structure to represent the biological object, and
some quantities characterizing trees become ill-defined. The point here is not to say that the
biological object is more complex than its mathematical representation but to say that the
biological variations can escape the mathematical frameworks used to represent them,
for principled reasons. This statement is not just a negative result but enables us to
introduce new rationales to make new predictions. Specifically, the method above aims
to pre-state some plausible variations at a character’s level. They are plausible since
they are close to existing and observed situations. This notion is akin to the adjacent
possibilities discussed by  S. A. Kauffman (<a href='#cite.0@kauf95'>1995</a>); however, its technical use is very
different since it does not assume pre-defined virtualities and aims instead to find some of
them. The method does not show that the plausible variations are genuinely possible;
a further biological discussion would be required to increase their plausibility, and,
ultimately, observations are required to show a genuine possibility (which we provide in our
example).
</p>
   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='general-aspects-of-new-possibilities-in-biology'><span class='titlemark'>5   </span> General aspects of new possibilities in biology</h3>
<!-- l. 159 --><p class='noindent'>Let us now go back to the general concept of new possibilities in biology as a fundamental, random
component of variations (a detailed discussion can be found in  Montévil, <a href='#cite.0@novelty2017'>2019</a>). To define this
notion precisely, let us first specify what a possibility is from our perspective. We aim to move
away from the essentialization of possibilities and possibility spaces, that is to say, taking spaces
and all their points as things that would exist by themselves. For example, in the simple case of
the position of an object on a straight line, the mathematical possibilities are unfathomable, and
almost all individual positions are ineffable (there are infinitely more real numbers than definitions
of <span class='ecti-1000'>individual </span>real numbers because the former are uncountable while the latter are countable).
However, this situation is not genuinely a problem for physics because mathematicians
and physicists can understand all these positions collectively, for example, by a generic
variable (often <span class='cmmi-10'>x</span>) and a differential equation that keeps the same form for all individual
positions – the latter are not made explicit because the reasoning operates on <span class='ecti-1000'>generic</span>
variables.
</p><!-- l. 161 --><p class='indent'>   In general, we argue that genuine possibilities for a system are configurations for which the
system determination is explicit, and in physics, it is typically performed by generic reasoning. For
example, free fall is an explicit possibility because the trajectory is essentially the same for all
positions (they follow the same equation). Similarly, a state at thermodynamic equilibrium is well
defined because its macroscopic properties determining the system, such as temperature or
pressure, are generic. Along the same line, DNA sequences have generic chemical properties, where
some sequences may be more stable than others, and, in this sense, they define chemical
possibilities.
</p><!-- l. 163 --><p class='indent'>   However, DNA sequences do not define biological possibilities because we observe a diversity of
related biological organizations. Indeed, to be a genuine possibility, a biological configuration needs
to be part of an organization that sustains it. Organizations determine the ability of a
living being to last over time and thus, among other things, determine the fate of these
DNA sequences. DNA sequences are combinatoric local possibilities (here chemical);
we call them pre-possibilities as they may or may not be associated with biological
possibilities, that is to say viable organizations in a given context. In this sense, the method
sketched above aims to find pre-possibilities that are plausible possibilities realized
empirically.
</p><!-- l. 165 --><p class='indent'>   Then, new possibilities are outcomes that do not follow a generic determination
given by the initial description, and <span class='ecti-1000'>a fortiori </span>are not generic outcomes. Let us give an
example to show why this definition is required. We can mathematize the trajectory
generated by neutral DNA mutations (mutations with no functional consequences)
by a random walk process. This process leads to a non-generic outcome (a singular
sequence); however, the random walk process is the same irrespective of the specific
sequence. Therefore it is not associated with the appearance of new possibilities. By
contrast, if specific sequences would lead to changes in the random-walk process, with the
                                                                            
                                                                            
emergence of chromosomes, sexual reproductions, etc., then it would be associated with a
change in the possibilities materialized by new quantities required to describe these
features.
</p><!-- l. 167 --><p class='indent'>   We emphasize that we focus on causal relationships, in the broad sense of the word, instead of
the space of possibility as a mathematical object. The reason for this stance is that, from an
epistemological perspective, an object’s space of description and the description of its causal
determination are intertwined and mutually dependent, as illustrated above. The key to
new possibilities is whether or not a generic description is sufficient to understand the
phenomenon. The mathematical space can change without the appearance of a new possibility
in the strong sense. For example, a room exchanges particles with its surroundings,
leading to supplementary quantities to describe their position and velocity. However, this
process does not represent genuine new possibilities because the particles that may
enter are of the same kind as those already in the system, and, accordingly, the same
equations describe them: a generic description is adequate to subsume them. By contrast,
biological molecules can do very diverse things, from enzymes to hormones or molecular
motors.
</p><!-- l. 169 --><p class='indent'>   Let us take a step back from these somewhat technical aspects. Possibilities in biology are
enabled diachronically by constraints, but they are also generated synchronically by them. For
example, the bones of an arm generate the possibility of its various positions and enabled the
appearance of various claws as well as human tools — the difference between the generation and
enablement is the opening of new possibilities in the latter. Moreover, as mentioned above,
biological constraints are part of an organization that sustains them and that they contribute to
sustaining, for example, by the concept of closure of constraints. Note that this concept does not
mean that organizations are static. Instead, enablement can take place at the level of an
individual. Moreover, some constraints, called propulsive constraints, contribute to organizations
only by enabling the appearance of new constraints ( Miquel &amp; Hwang, <a href='#cite.0@chapterPA'>2016</a> ; Montévil &amp;
Mossio, <a href='#cite.0@momoidentity2019'>2020</a>). For example, the mutator mechanism in bacteria leads them to undergo
more mutations under stress, thus leading to possible beneficial mutation in response
to this stress but without specificity in the mutations triggered. If we shift from the
language of constraints to possibilities, this framework implies that possibilities, in
biology, are actively sustained by organizations. In the last part of this chapter, we
will see that this implies that possibilities may also collapse when organizations are
disrupted.
</p><!-- l. 171 -->
   <h3 class='sectionHead' id='how-randomness-collapses-biological-diversity'><span class='titlemark'>6   </span> How randomness collapses biological diversity</h3>
<!-- l. 173 --><p class='noindent'>In a nutshell, biological possibilities appear over time and are actively sustained. It is a
critical notion that what we call new possibilities are singular or, in a sense, specific, by
contrast with generic situations. Biological possibilities are special configurations (among
pre-possibilities), and their specificity corresponds to the nature of their contribution to an
organization. For example, an enzyme can perform a function because it has a specific
sequence.
</p><!-- l. 175 --><p class='indent'>   Now, let us remark that, in the current scientific literature, the term "disruption" is a growing
keyword to describe the detrimental impact of human activities on biological organizations. We are
in the process of conceptualizing this notion, and we posit that an essential aspect of
disruptions in biology is the randomization of the specific configurations that stem
from history and are also specific contributions to organizations ( Montévil, <a href='#cite.0@montevilentropy'>2021</a> ,
<a href='#cite.0@montevildisruptionpp'>submitted</a>).
</p><!-- l. 177 --><p class='indent'>   Let us provide two examples. First, let us consider ecosystems where flowering plants and
pollinators are mutually dependent. Their interactions require the seasonal synchrony of their
feeding and flowering activity, respectively, so that plants undergo sexual reproduction and
pollinators do not starve. It follows that ecosystems are in a singular configuration for
activity periods. However, different species use different clues to start their activity, and
these clues are impacted differently by climate change. It follows that climate change
randomizes activity periods, and since the initial, singular situation is the condition of
possibility for the different species to maintain each other in the ecosystem, some species are
endangered or even disappear ( Burkle et al., <a href='#cite.0@Burkle1611'>2013</a> ; Memmott et al., <a href='#cite.0@disruptpol'>2007</a>). In this
process, part of the possibility space, here the activity periods of the different species,
                                                                            
                                                                            
collapses – the dimension of the description space describing the disappearing species
disappear.
</p><!-- l. 179 --><p class='indent'>   A second example is the case of endocrine disruptors, which is similar, albeit more complex.
Specific amounts of hormones at specific times during development are critical to canalizing
developmental processes of cellular differentiation, morphogenesis, and organogenesis leading to
viable and fertile adults ( Colborn et al., <a href='#cite.0@Colborn1993'>1993</a> ; Demeneix, <a href='#cite.0@demeneix2014losing'>2014</a>). Endocrine disruptors
randomize hormone action, thus the development process stemming from evolution.
These disruptions lead to decreased functions, such as decreased IQ, obesity, loss of fertility, or
cancer.
</p><!-- l. 181 --><p class='indent'>   What does this randomization mean? Existing constraints define pre-possibilities, for example,
all possible activity periods for the species of an ecosystem; however, only a tiny part of them are
genuine possibilities due to the species’ interdependence. Randomization means going from the
narrow domain of pre-possibilities that are possibilities (i.e., consistent with their own conditions
of possibility) to a larger domain, where part of the possibility space are no longer sustained and
thus disappear. This randomization is both an interpretation and a further specification of what
Bernard Stiegler called the increase in biological entropy ( Stiegler, <a href='#cite.0@stiegler2018neganthropocene'>2018</a>). Following Boltzman’s
schema, randomization as an increase in entropy means going from a part of a space with
specific properties to more generic properties. In biology, though, specific properties
result from history and go with viability. Thus this process is primarily a detrimental
one.
</p><!-- l. 183 --><p class='indent'>   In a sense, mutations are also this kind of process; most are neutral, others are detrimental,
and a few contribute to functions. Mutations illustrate the notion that new possibilities require an
exploration of pre-possibilities to find some possibilities among them, thus destabilizing
biological organizations. Last, mutations appear at a pace slow enough that they do
not destabilize populations, and the impact of detrimental ones is limited by natural
selection. If mutations were faster than they are, they would prevent DNA’s role in
heredity.
</p><!-- l. 185 --><p class='indent'>   The analysis of disruptions is not specific to anthropogenetic ones; however, the
characteristic of the current time is the acceleration and accumulation of disruptions.
Many living beings, species, or ecosystems cannot respond to them by generating new
possibilities fast enough to compensate for disruptions. In other words, the Anthropocene is,
to a large extent, a race between the destructive randomization of existing biological
possibilities, and the appearance of new, random possibilities, at all levels of biological
organization.
