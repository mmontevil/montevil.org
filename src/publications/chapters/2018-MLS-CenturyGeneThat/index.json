    "abstract": "Organisms, whether uni or multi-cellular, are agents that make their own norms; they continually express their ability to generate novelty and stability, that is to say they combine plasticity and robustness. Here, we briefly present and describe the three main principles that our group proposes for a theory of organisms, namely: the default state, proliferation with variation and motility, the principle of variation and the principle of organization. These principles profoundly modify biological observables and their theoretical nature compared to the situation in physical theories. This radical change opens up the possibility of anchoring mathematical modeling to biological principles.",
