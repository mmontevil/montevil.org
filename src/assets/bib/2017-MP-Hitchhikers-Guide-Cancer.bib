  abstract	= {Two main theories aim at understanding carcinogenesis: the
		  reductionist smt locates cancer in cancer cells, while the
		  organicist toft locates cancer at the tissue level. For
		  toft, the ‘cancer cell' is a phlogiston, smt is an old
		  paradigm which ought to be replaced. Recently two critics
		  have argued that toft and smt, despite their apparent
		  strong incompatibilities, are actually compatible. Here we
		  review their arguments. We show that these arguments are
		  based on interpretation mistakes that become understandable
		  once one grants that criticizing a paradigm from the point
		  of view of another, in which words do not have the same
		  signification, bears the risk of strong misunderstandings.
		  These misunderstandings, in our experience, are common. We
		  hope that this discussion will help clarifying the
		  differences between toft and smt.},
