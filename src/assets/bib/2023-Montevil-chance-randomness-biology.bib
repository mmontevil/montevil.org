  abstract	= {Physics has several concepts of randomness that build on
		  the idea that the possibilities are pre-given. By contrast,
		  an increasing number of theoretical biologists attempt to
		  introduce new possibilities, that is to say, changes of
		  possibility space â€“ an idea already discussed by Bergson
		  and that was not genuinely pursued scientifically until
		  recently (except, in a sense, in systematics, i.e, the
		  method to classify living beings). <br> Then, randomness
		  operates at the level of possibilities themselves and is
		  the basis of the historicity of biological objects. We
		  emphasize that this concept of randomness is not only
		  relevant when aiming to predict the future. Instead, it
		  shapes biological organizations and ecosystems. As an
		  illustration, we argue that a critical issue of the
		  Anthropocene is the disruption of the biological
		  organizations that natural history has shaped, leading to a
		  collapse of biological possibilities.}
