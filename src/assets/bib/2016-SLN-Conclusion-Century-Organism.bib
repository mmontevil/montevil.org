  abstract	= {Abstract Organisms, be they uni- or multi-cellular, are
		  agents capable of creating their own norms; they are
		  continuously harmonizing their ability to create novelty
		  and stability, that is, they combine plasticity with
		  robustness. Here we articulate the three principles for a
		  theory of organisms, namely: the default state of
		  proliferation with variation and motility, the principle of
		  variation and the principle of organization. These
		  principles profoundly change both biological observables
		  and their determination with respect to the theoretical
		  framework of physical theories. This radical change opens
		  up the possibility of anchoring mathematical modeling in
		  biologically proper principles.},
