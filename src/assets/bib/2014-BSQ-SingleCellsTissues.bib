  abstract	= {Background: Mammary gland morphogenesis involves ductal
		  elongation, branching, and budding. All of these processes
		  are mediated by stroma - epithelium interactions.
		  Biomechanical factors, such as matrix stiffness, have been
		  established as important factors in these interactions. For
		  example, epithelial cells fail to form normal acinar
		  structures in vitro in 3D gels that exceed the stiffness of
		  a normal mammary gland. Additionally, heterogeneity in the
		  spatial distribution of acini and ducts within individual
		  collagen gels suggests that local organization of the
		  matrix may guide morphogenesis. Here, we quantified the
		  effects of both bulk material stiffness and local collagen
		  fiber arrangement on epithelial morphogenesis. Results: The
		  formation of ducts and acini from single cells and the
		  reorganization of the collagen fiber network were
		  quantified using time-lapse confocal microscopy. MCF10A
		  cells organized the surrounding collagen fibers during the
		  first twelve hours after seeding. Collagen fiber density
		  and alignment relative to the epithelial surface
		  significantly increased within the first twelve hours and
		  were a major influence in the shaping of the mammary
		  epithelium. The addition of Matrigel to the collagen fiber
		  network impaired cell-mediated reorganization of the matrix
		  and increased the probability of spheroidal acini rather
		  than branching ducts. The mechanical anisotropy created by
		  regions of highly aligned collagen fibers facilitated
		  elongation and branching, which was significantly
		  correlated with fiber organization. In contrast, changes in
		  bulk stiffness were not a strong predictor of this
		  epithelial morphology. Conclusions: Localized regions of
		  collagen fiber alignment are required for ductal elongation
		  and branching suggesting the importance of local mechanical
		  anisotropy in mammary epithelial morphogenesis. Similar
		  principles may govern the morphology of branching and
		  budding in other tissues and organs.},
