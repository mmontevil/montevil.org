  abstract	= {This paper analyzes, in terms of critical transitions, the
		  phase spaces of biological dynamics. The phase space is the
		  space where the scientific description and determination of
		  a phenomenon is given. We argue that one major aspect of
		  biological evolution is the continual change of the
		  pertinent phase space and the unpredictability of these
		  changes. This analysis will be based on the theoretical
		  symmetries in biology and on their critical instability
		  along evolution. Our hypothesis deeply modifies the tools
		  and concepts used in physical theorizing, when adapted to
		  biology. In particular, we argue that causality has to be
		  understood differently, and we discuss two notions to do
		  so: differential causality and enablement. In this context
		  constraints play a key role: on one side, they restrict
		  possibilities, on the other, they enable biological systems
		  to integrate changing constraints in their organization, by
		  correlated variations, in un-prestatable ways. This
		  corresponds to the formation of new phenotypes and
		  organisms.},
