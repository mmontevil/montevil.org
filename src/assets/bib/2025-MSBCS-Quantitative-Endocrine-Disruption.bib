  abstract	= {Endocrine disruptors alter mammary gland development,
		  impair the ability to nourish offspring, and increase the
		  cancer risk in animal models. Epidemiological studies
		  reveal trends towards early mammary development, nursing
		  problems, and breast cancer in younger women. Morphological
		  changes in mouse postnatal mammary gland development are
		  considered sensitive markers of endocrine disruption. While
		  the mouse mammary gland is easily amenable to morphometric
		  measurements from the fetal stage to full maturity, the rat
		  mammary gland grows more conspicuously into the third
		  dimension, hindering conventional morphometric analysis.
		  However, since rats are more commonly used in international
		  toxicological reproductive studies, it would be beneficial
		  to include mammary gland whole-mount analysis in these
		  studies. Using our quantitative software to perform
		  computer-driven analysis of the rat mammary epithelium we
		  examined the effects of gestational and postnatal exposure
		  to ketoconazole, an antifungal medication that affects
		  steroidogenesis, and to the estrogen diethylstilbestrol in
		  the mammary glands of 6- and 22-day-old females. Both
		  treatments produced effects at both ages; the epithelium
		  was smaller and less complex in exposed animals compared to
		  controls. Global analysis with the permutation test showed
		  that morphological evaluation of the PND22 mammary gland is
		  sensitive to endocrine disruption and possibly
		  non-monotonic. In addition to revealing that ketoconazole
		  altered the mammary gland structure, these results suggest
		  that for future toxicology studies, day 22 (at weaning) is
		  more suitable than day 6 because it showed significant
		  measurements and trends. If the collection of mammary
		  glands is added to existing international test methods,
		  PND22 could be a relevant time point.}
