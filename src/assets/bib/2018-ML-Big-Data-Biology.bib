  abstract	= {Summary Biology is a field in which variation has a
		  fundamental theoretical role. Faced with the diversity of
		  the living and faced with the internal heterogeneity of
		  organisms, the human mind can sometimes seem a bit
		  powerless. The contemporary possibility of developing
		  immense digital databases, collaboratively, therefore
		  appears as a major opportunity. The application of big data
		  to cancer is done within a specific theoretical framework,
		  in which the carcinogenesis process is conceived as the
		  appearance of cancerous cells through the accumulation of
		  somatic mutations. Mathematics allows us to demonstrate the
		  limits of these purely algorithmic methods by showing the
		  impossibility of replacing the scientific quest for meaning
		  with pure “data mining”. Theorems at the crossroads
		  between ergodic theory and the Ramsey theory, a combinatory
		  theory of numbers proposed in the 1920s and significantly
		  developed since, contradict this use of Big Data.},

  abstract	= {Some authors assert that the analysis of huge databases
		  could replace the scientific method. On the contrary, we
		  argue that the best way to make these new technologies bear
		  fruits is to frame them with theories concerning the
		  phenomena of interest. Such theories hint to the observable
		  that should be taken into account and the mathematical
		  structures that may link them. In biology, we argue that
		  the community urgently needs an overarching theory of
		  organisms that would provide a precise framework to
		  understand lifecycles. Among other benefits, such a theory
		  should make explicit what we can and cannot predict in
		  principle.},
