  abstract	= {Bifurcating means: reconstituting a political economy that
		  reconnects local knowledge and practices with macroeconomic
		  circulation and rethinks territoriality at its different
		  scales of locality; developing an economy of contribution
		  on the basis of a contributory income no longer tied to
		  employment and once again valuing work as a knowledge
		  activity; overhauling law, and government and corporate
		  accounting, via economic and social experiments, including
		  in laboratory territories, and in relation to cooperative,
		  local market economies formed into networks and linked to
		  international trade; revaluing research from a long-term
		  perspective, independent of the short-term interests of
		  political and economic powers; reorienting digital
		  technology in the service of territories and territorial
		  cooperation. <br> The collective work that produced this
		  book is based on the claim that today’s destructive
		  development model is reaching its ultimate limits, and that
		  its toxicity, which is increasingly massive, manifest and
		  multidimensional (medical, environmental, mental,
		  epistemological, economic – accumulating pockets of
		  insolvency, which become veritable oceans), is generated
		  above all by the fact that the current industrial economy
		  is based in every sector on an obsolete physical model –
		  a mechanism that ignores the constraints of locality in
		  biology and the entropic tendency in reticulated
		  computational information. In these gravely perilous times,
		  we must bifurcate: there is no alternative. },
