  abstract	= { In their brave and challenging book, grounded in
		  political science and the Continental philosophical
		  tradition, Divya Dwivedi and Shaj Mohan engage with the
		  resurgence of upper-caste supremacism in India and its
		  justification via the legacy of ‘the Aryan doctrine’
		  and Hindu nationalism. Their essays were written from 2016
		  to 2023, when India’s democratic institutions were
		  subverted and caste-based oppression overflowed into public
		  space―killing and menacing the lower castes of all
		  religions, minorities, women, students and the media. <br>
		  This book chronicles the ascending oppression of democracy
		  in India, a veritable biography of authoritarianism.
		  Dwivedi and Mohan reject simplistic accounts of India’s
		  politics as the opposition between ‘Hindu majoritarian
		  nationalism’ and ‘the religious minorities’, or
		  between ‘Hindu fundamentalism’ and ‘religious
		  pluralism’. They propose instead a genuinely
		  transformative account of Indian politics, grounded in
		  political philosophy and in the lower- caste majority
		  position <br> What does revolution mean where the
		  constitutional promise of equality is betrayed daily by the
		  millennia- old inequality of caste? What does politics mean
		  where religion serves as the justification for descent-
		  based enslavement and indignity? Revolution has only one
		  sense in India, the annihilation of caste; and
		  ‘citizen’ has only one sense, the people of the state
		  shedding caste and racism. },
