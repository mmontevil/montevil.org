  abstract	= {computational, physical and teleological theory for
		  understanding biological organization as cognitive agent
		  minimizing their entropy in relation to their environment.
		  Is minimizing entropy the first principle driving all
		  dynamics of cognition ? Is it enough to account for
		  organizational changes in an open-ended way ? After a
		  general presentation of the literature on the FEP, we turn
		  to the paradoxical case of the brain under the influence of
		  psychedelics, where the FEP is challenged by an increased
		  cerebral entropy, which induces organizational changes of
		  the cognition. Building on this paradox, we identify some
		  limits of the FEP, notably applying concepts of
		  information, optimization and predefined phase space to
		  biology that do not fit our criteria for a theory of
		  biological organization. We also identify two aspects of
		  entropy in physics and in the FEP: the local entropic trend
		  that implies variations and the global entropic trend that
		  leads to homogeneization and stability. Extending these
		  concepts outside of their physicomathematical context, we
		  contribute to an organicist theoretical alternative where
		  living systems find a balance between these two trends,
		  and, conceptually, a biological system's disorganization
		  enable its "unprestatable" reorganization and so its
		  open-ended evolution.}
