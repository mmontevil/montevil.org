  abstract	= { The analogy between living beings and computers was
		  introduced with circumspection by Schrödinger and has been
		  widely propagated since, rarely with a precise technical
		  meaning. Critics of this perspective are numerous. We
		  emphasize that this perspective is mobilized to justify
		  what may be called a regressive reductionism by comparison
		  with physics or the Cartesian method. <br> Other views on
		  the living are possible, and we focus on an epistemological
		  and theoretical framework where historicity is central, and
		  the regularities susceptible to mathematization are
		  constraints whose existence is fundamentally precarious and
		  historically contingent. <br> We then propose to
		  reinterpret the computer, no longer as a Turing machine but
		  as constituted by constraints. This move allows us to
		  understand that computation in the sense of Church-Turing
		  is only a part of the theoretical determination of what
		  actually happens in a computer when considering them in
		  their larger theoretical context where historicity is also
		  central.},
