  abstract	= {Unlike inert objects, organisms and their cells have the
		  ability to initiate activity by themselves, and thus change
		  their properties or states even in the absence of an
		  external cause. This crucial difference led us to search
		  for principles suitable for the study organisms. We propose
		  that cells follow the default state of proliferation with
		  variation and motility, a principle of biological inertia.
		  This means that in the presence of sufficient nutrients,
		  cells will express their default state. We also propose a
		  principle of variation that addresses two central features
		  of organisms, variation and historicity. To address
		  interdependence between parts, we use a third principle,
		  the principle of organization: more specifically, the
		  notion of the closure of constraints. Within this
		  theoretical framework, constraints are specific theoretical
		  entities defined by their relative stability with respect
		  to the processes they constrain. Constraints are mutually
		  dependent in an organized system and act on the default
		  state. <br>
		  
		  Here we discuss the application and articulation of these
		  principles for mathematical modeling of morphogenesis in a
		  specific case, that of mammary ductal morphogenesis, with
		  an emphasis on the default state. Our model has both a
		  biological component, the cells, and a physical component,
		  the matrix that contains collagen fibers. Cells are agents
		  that move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert
		  mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on
		  other cells. As fibers are organized, they constrain the
		  cells’ ability to move and to proliferate. This model
		  exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of
		  the closure of constraints. Implementing our mathematical
		  model shows that constraints to the default state are
		  sufficient to explain the formation of mammary epithelial
		  structures. Finally, the success of this modeling effort
		  suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional
		  constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism can be
		  examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and in
		  vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist
		  perspective we embrace.},
