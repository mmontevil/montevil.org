  abstract	= {Unlike inert objects, organisms and their cells have the
		  ability to initiate activity by themselves, and thus change
		  their properties or states even in the absence of an
		  external cause. This crucial difference led us to search
		  for principles suitable for the study organisms. We propose
		  that cells follow the default state of proliferation with
		  variation and motility, a principle of biological inertia.
		  This means that in the presence of sufficient nutrients,
		  cells will express their default state. We also propose a
		  principle of variation that addresses two central features
		  of organisms, variation and historicity. To address
		  interdependence between parts, we use a third principle,
		  the principle of organization: more specifically, the
		  notion of the closure of constraints. Within this
		  theoretical framework, constraints are specific theoretical
		  entities defined by their relative stability with respect
		  to the processes they constrain. Constraints are mutually
		  dependent in an organized system and act on the default
		  state. <br>
		  
		  Here we discuss the application and articulation of these
		  principles for mathematical modeling of morphogenesis in a
		  specific case, that of mammary ductal morphogenesis, with
		  an emphasis on the default state. Our model has both a
		  biological component, the cells, and a physical component,
		  the matrix that contains collagen fibers. Cells are agents
		  that move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert
		  mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on
		  other cells. As fibers are organized, they constrain the
		  cells’ ability to move and to proliferate. This model
		  exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of
		  the closure of constraints. Implementing our mathematical
		  model shows that constraints to the default state are
		  sufficient to explain the formation of mammary epithelial
		  structures. Finally, the success of this modeling effort
		  suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional
		  constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism can be
		  examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and in
		  vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist
		  perspective we embrace.},

		  Accordingly, we put forward a hybrid conception, in which
		  historical and relational (and more specifically,

		  justify each other. Moreover, we argue that organisms'
		  identity is not only hybrid but also bounded, insofar as
		  the compliance with specific identity criteria tends to
		  vanish as time passes, especially across generations. We
		  spell out the core conceptual framework of this conception,

  abstract	= {Abstract In multicellular organisms, relations among parts
		  and between parts and the whole are contextual and
		  interdependent. These organisms and their cells are
		  ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that
		  divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in
		  tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and
		  cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This
		  contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to
		  establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we
		  propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic
		  difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an
		  experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to
		  obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts
		  and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological
		  principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling
		  in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts
		  developed originally in physics or computer sciences.
		  Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based
		  on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use
		  principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of
		  a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell
		  proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the
		  principle of organization by closure of constraints. This
		  model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical
		  component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells
		  display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained;
		  they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers
		  and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain
		  the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The
		  model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in
		  terms of closure of constraints. Implementing the
		  mathematical model shows that constraints to the default
		  state are sufficient to explain ductal and acinar
		  formation, and points to a target of future research,
		  namely, to inhibitors of cell proliferation and motility
		  generated by the epithelial cells. The success of this
		  model suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional
		  constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism could be

  abstract	= {In this article, we apply the perspective of
		  intraorganismal ecology by investigating a family of
		  ecological models suitable to describe a gene therapy for a
		  particular metabolic disorder, the adenosine deaminase
		  deficiency. The gene therapy is modeled as the prospective
		  ecological invasion of an organ (here, bone marrow) by
		  genetically modified stem cells, which then operate niche
		  construction in the cellular environment by releasing an
		  enzyme they synthesize. We show that depending on the order
		  chosen for the model (a choice that cannot be made on a
		  priori assumptions), different kinds of dynamics are
		  expected, possibly leading to different therapeutic
		  strategies. This drives us to discuss several features of
		  the extension of ecology to intraorganismal ecology.},

  abstract	= {In this article, we discuss the perspective of
		  intraorganismal ecology by investigating a family of
		  ecological models. We consider two types of models.
		  First-order models describe the population dynamics as
		  being directly affected by ecological factors (here
		  understood as nutrients, space, etc). They might be thought
		  of as analogous to Aristotelian physics. Second-order
		  models describe the population dynamics as being indirectly
		  affected, the ecological factors now affecting the
		  derivative of the growth rate (that is, the population
		  acceleration), possibly through an impact on nongenetically
		  inherited factors. Second-order models might be thought of
		  as analogous to Galilean physics. In a companion article,
		  we apply these ideas to a situation of gene therapy.},

  abstract	= {This paper analyzes, in terms of critical transitions, the
		  phase spaces of biological dynamics. The phase space is the
		  space where the scientific description and determination of
		  a phenomenon is given. We argue that one major aspect of
		  biological evolution is the continual change of the
		  pertinent phase space and the unpredictability of these
		  changes. This analysis will be based on the theoretical
		  symmetries in biology and on their critical instability
		  along evolution. Our hypothesis deeply modifies the tools
		  and concepts used in physical theorizing, when adapted to
		  biology. In particular, we argue that causality has to be
		  understood differently, and we discuss two notions to do
		  so: differential causality and enablement. In this context
		  constraints play a key role: on one side, they restrict
		  possibilities, on the other, they enable biological systems
		  to integrate changing constraints in their organization, by
		  correlated variations, in un-prestatable ways. This
		  corresponds to the formation of new phenotypes and
		  organisms.},
