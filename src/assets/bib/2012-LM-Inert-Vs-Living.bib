  abstract	= {The physical singularity of life phenomena is analyzed by
		  means of comparison with the driving concepts of theories
		  of the inert. We outline conceptual analogies, transferals
		  of methodologies and theoretical instruments between
		  physics and biology, in addition to indicating significant
		  differences and sometimes logical dualities. In order to
		  make biological phenomenalities intelligible, we introduce
		  theoretical extensions to certain physical theories. In
		  this synthetic paper, we summarize and propose a unified
		  conceptual framework for the main conclusions drawn from
		  work spanning a book and several articles, quoted
		  throughout.},
