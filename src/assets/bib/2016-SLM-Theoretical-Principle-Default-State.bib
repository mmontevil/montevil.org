  abstract	= {Abstract The principle of inertia is central to the modern
		  scientific revolution. By postulating this principle
		  Galileo at once identified a pertinent physical observable
		  (momentum) and a conservation law (momentum conservation).
		  He then could scientifically analyze what modifies inertial
		  movement: gravitation and friction. Inertia, the default
		  state in mechanics, represented a major theoretical
		  commitment: there is no need to explain uniform rectilinear
		  motion, rather, there is a need to explain departures from
		  it. By analogy, we propose a biological default state of
		  proliferation with variation and motility. From this
		  theoretical commitment, what requires explanation is
		  proliferative quiescence, lack of variation, lack of
		  movement. That proliferation is the default state is
		  axiomatic for biologists studying unicellular organisms.
		  Moreover, it is implied in Darwin's “descent with
		  modification”. Although a “default state” is a
		  theoretical construct and a limit case that does not need
		  to be instantiated, conditions that closely resemble
		  unrestrained cell proliferation are readily obtained
		  experimentally. We will illustrate theoretical and
		  experimental consequences of applying and of ignoring this
		  principle.},
