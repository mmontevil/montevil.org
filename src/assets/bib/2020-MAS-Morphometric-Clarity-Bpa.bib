  abstract	= {We aimed to a) determine whether BPA showed effects on the
		  developing rat mammary gland using new quantitative and
		  established semiquantitative methods in two laboratories,
		  b) develop a software tool for automatic evaluation of
		  quantifiable aspects of the mammary ductal tree, and c)
		  compare those methods. Conclusions: Both the
		  semiquantitative and the quantitative methods revealed
		  nonmonotonic effects of BPA. The quantitative unsupervised
		  analysis used 91 measurements and produced the most
		  striking nonmonotonic dose–response curves. At all time
		  points, lower doses resulted in larger effects, consistent
		  with the core study, which revealed a significant increase
		  of mammary adenocarcinoma incidence in the stop-dose
		  animals at the lowest BPA dose tested.},
