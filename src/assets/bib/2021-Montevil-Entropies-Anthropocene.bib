  abstract	= {The Anthropocene crisis is frequently described as the
		  rarefaction of resources or resources per capita. However,
		  both energy and minerals correspond to fundamentally
		  conserved quantities from the perspective of physics. A
		  specific concept is required to understand the rarefaction
		  of available resources. This concept, entropy, pertains to
		  energy and matter configurations and not just to their
		  sheer amount. However, the physics concept of entropy is
		  insufficient to understand biological and social
		  organizations. Biological phenomena display both
		  historicity and systemic properties. A biological
		  organization, the ability of a specific living being to
		  last over time, results from history, expresses itself by
		  systemic properties, and may require generating novelties
		  The concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination of
		  these features. We propose that Anthropocene changes
		  disrupt biological organizations by randomizing them, that
		  is, decreasing anti-entropy. Moreover, second-order
		  disruptions correspond to the decline of the ability to
		  produce functional novelties, that is, to produce
		  anti-entropy.},
