  abstract	= { The Anthropocene crisis is frequently described as the
		  rarefaction of resources or resources per capita. However,
		  both energy and minerals correspond to fundamentally
		  conserved quantities from the perspective of physics. A
		  specific concept is required to understand the rarefaction
		  of available resources. This concept, entropy, pertains to
		  energy and matter configurations and not just to their
		  sheer amount. <br> However, the physics concept of entropy
		  is insufficient to understand biological and social
		  organizations. Biological phenomena display both
		  historicity and systemic properties. A biological
		  organization, the ability of a specific living being to
		  last over time, results from history, expresses itself by
		  systemic properties, and may require generating novelties
		  The concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination of
		  these features. We propose that Anthropocene changes
		  disrupt biological organizations by randomizing them, that
		  is, decreasing anti-entropy. Moreover, second-order
		  disruptions correspond to the decline of the ability to
		  produce functional novelties, that is, to produce
		  anti-entropy. },
