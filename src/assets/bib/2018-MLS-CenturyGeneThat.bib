  abstract	= {Summary This chapter briefly presents and describes the
		  three main principles that the group proposes for a theory
		  of organisms, namely: the default state, proliferation with
		  variation and motility, the principle of variation and the
		  principle of organization. It is crucial to critique the
		  philosophical and theoretical position on which the
		  biological research feeding into the program is based and
		  which has dominated biomedical research for the last 70
		  years. Physical theories are founded on stable mathematical
		  structures, based onregularities and especially on
		  theoretical symmetries. At the time of cell theory
		  formulation and still today, cell theory plays a federating
		  role between evolution biology and organism biology.
		  Finally, analysis of the differences between the physics of
		  inanimate and living matter leads to the proposal of three
		  principles that provide aviable perspective for the
		  construction of a necessary theory of organisms.},
