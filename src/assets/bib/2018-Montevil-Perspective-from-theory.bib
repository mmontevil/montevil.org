		  http://constructivist.info/13/3/362.palfreyman Upshot: I
		  discuss convergences between the approach of the authors
		  and my work aiming for a theory of organisms. I also
		  discuss some pitfalls and challenges pertaining to
		  biological randomness, which, I argue, require original
		  developments.},
