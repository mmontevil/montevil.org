  abstract	= {This focused issue of Progress in Biophysics and Molecular
		  Biology is entitled "From the century of the genome to the
		  century of the organism: New theoretical approaches." It
		  was developed during Ana M. Soto’s tenure as Blaise
		  Pascal Chair of Biology 2013-15 at the Ecole Normale
		  Supérieure (ENS, Paris, France). Giuseppe Longo was the
		  Pascal Chair host at the ENS. This ongoing theoretical was
		  also used as the content of a 10 session course attended by
		  graduate students and post-graduates, which took place at
		  the National Museum of Natural History and at the ENS. The
		  attendants of course encouraged the guest editors to make
		  this material easily available, hence the origin of PBMB
		  issue.},
