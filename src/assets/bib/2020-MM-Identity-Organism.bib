  abstract	= {We address the identity of biological organisms at play in
		  experimental and modeling practices. We first examine the
		  central tenets of two general conceptions, and we assess
		  their respective strengths and weaknesses. The historical
		  conception, on the one hand, characterizes organisms'
		  identity by looking at their past, and specifically at
		  their genealogical connection with a common ancestor. The
		  relational conception, on the other hand, interprets
		  organisms' identity by referring to a set of distinctive
		  relations between their parts, and between the organism and
		  its environment. While the historical and relational
		  conceptions are understood as opposed and conflicting, we
		  submit that they are also fundamentally complementary.
		  Accordingly, we put forward a hybrid conception, in which
		  historical and relational (and more specifically,
		  organizational) aspects of organisms' identity sustain and
		  justify each other. Moreover, we argue that organisms'
		  identity is not only hybrid but also bounded, insofar as
		  the compliance with specific identity criteria tends to
		  vanish as time passes, especially across generations. We
		  spell out the core conceptual framework of this conception,
		  and we outline an original formal representation. We
		  contend that the hybrid and bounded conception of
		  organisms' identity suits the epistemological needs of
		  biological practices, particularly with regards to the
		  generalization and reproducibility of experimental results,
		  and the integration of mathematical models with
		  experiments.},
