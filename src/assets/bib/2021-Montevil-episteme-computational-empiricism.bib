  abstract	= {What do mainstream scientists acknowledge as original
		  scientific contributions? In other words, what is the
		  current épistémè in natural sciences? This essay
		  attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational
		  empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical,
		  generating data and computational, to analyze them and
		  reproduce them with models. This épistémè values
		  primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus
		  leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes
		  attention-catching results showing limits of earlier
		  theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does
		  not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a
		  state of theory disruption.},
