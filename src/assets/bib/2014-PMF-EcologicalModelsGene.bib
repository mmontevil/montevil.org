  abstract	= {In this article, we apply the perspective of
		  intraorganismal ecology by investigating a family of
		  ecological models suitable to describe a gene therapy for a
		  particular metabolic disorder, the adenosine deaminase
		  deficiency. The gene therapy is modeled as the prospective
		  ecological invasion of an organ (here, bone marrow) by
		  genetically modified stem cells, which then operate niche
		  construction in the cellular environment by releasing an
		  enzyme they synthesize. We show that depending on the order
		  chosen for the model (a choice that cannot be made on a
		  priori assumptions), different kinds of dynamics are
		  expected, possibly leading to different therapeutic
		  strategies. This drives us to discuss several features of
		  the extension of ecology to intraorganismal ecology.},
