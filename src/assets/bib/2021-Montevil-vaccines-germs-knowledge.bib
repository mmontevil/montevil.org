  abstract	= {Vaccines for COVID-19 have led to questions, debates, and
		  polemics on both their safety and the political and
		  geopolitical dimension of their use. We propose to take a
		  step back on both the history of this practice and how
		  current theories in immunology understand it. Both can
		  contribute to providing a rational assessment of COVID-19
		  vaccines. This assessment cannot consider vaccine as an
		  isolated procedure, and we discuss its intergradation with
		  the broader question of knowledge and politics in the
		  COVID-19 pandemic.},
