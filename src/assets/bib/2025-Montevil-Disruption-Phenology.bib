  abstract	= {Biologists are increasingly documenting anthropogenic
		  disruptions, both at the organism and ecosystem levels,
		  indicating that these disruptions are a fundamental,
		  qualitative component of the Anthropocene. Nonetheless, the
		  notion of disruption has yet to be theorized. Informally,
		  disruptions are direct or indirect consequences of specific
		  causes that impair the contribution of parts of living
		  systems to their ability to last over time. To progress in
		  this theorization, we work here on a particular case. Even
		  relatively minor temperature changes can significantly
		  impact plant-pollinator synchrony, disrupting mutualistic
		  interaction networks. Understanding this phenomenon
		  requires a specific rationale since models describing it
		  use both historical and systemic reasoning. Specifically,
		  history justifies that the ecosystem initially exists in a
		  very narrow part of the possibility space where all its
		  populations are viable, and the disruption leads to a more
		  generic configuration where some populations are not
		  viable. Building on this rationale, we develop a
		  mathematical schema inspired by Boltzmann's entropy, apply
		  it to this situation, and provide a technical definition of
		  disruption.},
