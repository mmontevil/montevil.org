  abstract	= {Abstract In multicellular organisms, relations among parts
		  and between parts and the whole are contextual and
		  interdependent. These organisms and their cells are
		  ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that
		  divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in
		  tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and
		  cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This
		  contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to
		  establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we
		  propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic
		  difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an
		  experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to
		  obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts
		  and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological
		  principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling
		  in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts
		  developed originally in physics or computer sciences.
		  Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based
		  on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use
		  principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of
		  a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell
		  proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the
		  principle of organization by closure of constraints. This
		  model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical
		  component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells
		  display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained;
		  they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers
		  and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain
		  the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The
		  model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in
		  terms of closure of constraints. Implementing the
		  mathematical model shows that constraints to the default
		  state are sufficient to explain ductal and acinar
		  formation, and points to a target of future research,
		  namely, to inhibitors of cell proliferation and motility
		  generated by the epithelial cells. The success of this
		  model suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional
		  constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism could be
		  examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and
		  in vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist
		  perspective we embrace.},
