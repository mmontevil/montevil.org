  abstract	= {Biological evolution is a complex blend of ever changing
		  structural stability, variability and emergence of new phe-
		  notypes, niches, ecosystems. We wish to argue that the evo-
		  lution of life marks the end of a physics world view of law
		  entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon dis-
		  cussing the variability of the very ”contexts of life”:
		  the in- teractions between organisms, biological niches and
		  ecosys- tems. These are ever changing, intrinsically
		  indeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead
		  of time the ”niches” which constitute the boundary
		  conditions on selec- tion. More generally, by the
		  mathematical unprestatability of the ”phase space”
		  (space of possibilities), no laws of mo- tion can be
		  formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,
		  from life to life. The purpose of this paper is the
		  integration of variation and diversity in a sound concep-
		  tual frame and situate unpredictability at a novel
		  theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our
		  argument will be carried on in close comparisons with
		  physics and the mathematical constructions of phase spaces
		  in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as
		  invariant preserving transformations will allow us to
		  under- stand the nature of physical phase spaces and to
		  stress the differences required for a sound biological
		  theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of
		  ”enablement”. Life lives in a web of enablement and
		  radical emergence. This will restrict causal analyses to
		  differential cases (a difference that causes a difference).
		  Mutations or other causal differ- ences will allow us to
		  stress that ”non conservation princi- ples” are at the
		  core of evolution, in contrast to physical dynamics,
		  largely based on conservation principles as sym- metries.
		  Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry changes in
		  physics, will be discussed, and lead to ”extended
		  criticality” as a conceptual frame for a better
		  understanding of the living state of matter.},
