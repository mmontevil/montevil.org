		  originated the idea that precise measurements would lead to
		  better therapeutic strategies. However, precision does not
		  entail accuracy. Scientific accuracy requires a theoretical
		  framework to understand the meaning of measurements, the
		  nature of causal relationships, and potential intrinsic
		  limitations of knowledge. For example, a precise
		  measurement of initial positions in classical mechanics is
		  useless without initial velocities; it is not an accurate
		  measurement of the initial condition. Conceptual and
		  theoretical accuracy is required for precision to lead to
		  the progress of knowledge and rationality in action. In the
		  search for accuracy in medicine, we first outline our
		  results on a theory of organisms. Biology is distinct from
		  physics and requires a specific epistemology. In
		  particular, we develop the meaning of biological
		  measurements and emphasize that variability and historicity
		  are fundamental notions. However, medicine is not just
		  biology; we articulate the historicity of biological norms
		  that stems from evolution and the idea that patients and
		  groups of patients generate new norms to overcome
		  pathological situations. Patients then play an active role,
		  in line with the philosophy of Georges Canguilhem. We argue
		  that taking this dimension of medicine into account is
		  critical for theoretical accuracy.},
