  abstract	= {The contemporary Anthropocene crisis is frequently
		  described as the rarefaction of resources or resources per
		  capita. However, both energy and minerals correspond to
		  fundamentally conserved quantities from a physical
		  perspective. A specific concept is required to understand
		  the rarefaction of these resources. This concept, entropy,
		  pertains to the configurations of energy and matter and not
		  just to their sheer amount. However, the physical concept
		  of entropy is insufficient to understand biological and
		  social organizations. Biological phenomena display both
		  historicity and more synchronic, systemic properties. The
		  concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination of these
		  aspects. We propose that many vulnerabilities of living
		  entities to the changes of the Anthropocene pertain to
		  anti-entropy. They correspond to the entropization of
		  anti-entropy, that is, a loss of organization. They can
		  also be the disruption of anti-entropy production, that is
		  to say, the loss of the ability to produce functional
		  novelties.},
