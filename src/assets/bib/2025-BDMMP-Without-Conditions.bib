  abstract	= {Do the Palestinian people and the Ukrainian people
		  understand one another? Do they support one another? What
		  are the similarities and the distinctions between these two
		  conditions of oppression? The question of Ukraine and
		  Palestine are one for this reason; no condition, no
		  argument, no geo-poli-technique can justify what is taking
		  place in either regions. Further, none of the so-called
		  solutions to Ukraine—divide it between Russia, Europe and
		  America—is acceptable because the very existence of
		  freedom, which is what people are, what each individual is,
		  is going to be thus divided and partitioned, and hence
		  annihilated.}
