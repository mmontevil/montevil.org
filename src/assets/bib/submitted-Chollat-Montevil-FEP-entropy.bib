  abstract	= { The free-energy principle (FEP) furnishes a
		  computational, physical and teleological theory for
		  understanding biological organization as cognitive agent
		  minimizing their entropy in relation to their environment.
		  Is minimizing entropy the first principle driving all
		  dynamics of cognition ? Is it enough to account for
		  organizational changes in a open-ended way ? After a
		  general presentation of the literature on FEP, we then turn
		  to the paradoxical case of the brain under the influence of
		  psychedelics, where FEP is challenged by an increased
		  cerebral entropy, which induces organizational changes of
		  the cognition. From on this paradox, we then identify some
		  limits of the FEP, notably applying concepts of
		  information, optimization and predefined phase space to
		  biology, which does not account for strong organizational
		  changes. We therefore propose an organicist theoretical
		  alternative with the concept of anti-entropy, explaining
		  how a biological system's disorganization can enable its
		  "unprestatable" reorganization and so its open-ended
		  evolution. We finally rediscuss the concept of activity
		  and passivity of living beings and the notion that their
		  default state corresponds to an activity.}
