  abstract	= {Biological thinking is structured by the notion of level
		  of organization. We will show that this notion acquires a
		  precise meaning in critical phenomena: they disrupt, by the
		  appearance of infinite quantities, the mathematical
		  (possibly equational) determination at a given level, when
		  moving at an ``higher'' one. As a result, their analysis
		  cannot be called genuinely bottom-up, even though it
		  remains upward in a restricted sense. At the same time,
		  criticality and related phenomena are very common in
		  biology. Because of this, we claim that bottom-up
		  approaches are not sufficient, in principle, to capture
		  biological phenomena. In the second part of this paper,
		  following the work of Francis Bailly, we discuss a strong
		  criterium of level transition. The core idea of the
		  criterium is to start from the breaking of the symmetries
		  and determination at a ``first'' level in order to ``move''
		  at the others. If biological phenomena have multiple,
		  \emph{sustained} levels of organization in this sense, then
		  they should be interpreted as \emph{extended} critical
		  transitions.},
