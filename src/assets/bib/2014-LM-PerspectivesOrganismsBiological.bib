  abstract	= {This authored monograph introduces a genuinely theoretical
		  approach to biology. Starting point is the investigation of
		  empirical biological scaling including their variability,
		  which is found in the literature, e.g. allometric
		  relationships, fractals, etc. The book then analyzes two
		  different aspects of biological time: first, a
		  supplementary temporal dimension to accommodate proper
		  biological rhythms; secondly, the concepts of protension
		  and retention as a means of local organization of time in
		  living organisms. Moreover, the book investigates the role
		  of symmetry in biology, in view of its ubiquitous
		  importance in physics. In relation with the notion of
		  extended critical transitions, the book proposes that
		  organisms and their evolution can be characterized by
		  continued symmetry changes, which accounts for the
		  irreducibility of their historicity and variability. The
		  authors also introduce the concept of anti-entropy as a
		  measure for the potential of variability, being equally
		  understood as alterations in symmetry. By this, the book
		  provides a mathematical account of Gould's analysis of
		  phenotypic complexity with respect to biological evolution.
		  The target audience primarily comprises researchers
		  interested in new theoretical approaches to biology, from
		  physical, biological or philosophical backgrounds, but the
		  book may also be beneficial for graduate students who want
		  to enter this field.},
