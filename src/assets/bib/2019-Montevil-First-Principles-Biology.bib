  abstract	= {Like theoretical physics, theoretical biology is not just
		  mathematical modeling. Instead, theoretical biology should
		  strive to find suitable first principles to ground the
		  understanding of biological phenomena and ultimately frame
		  biological experiments and mathematical models. First
		  principles in physics are expressed in terms of symmetries
		  and the associated conservations, on the one side, and
		  optimization on the other side. In biology, we argue
		  instead that a strong notion of variation is fundamental.
		  This notion encompasses new possibilities and the
		  historicity of biological phenomena. By contrast, the
		  relative regularity of some aspects of biological
		  organisms, which we call constraints, should be regarded as
		  the consequence of a mutual stabilization of the parts of
		  organisms. We exemplify several aspects of this framework
		  with the modeling of allometric relationships. Our change
		  of perspective leads to reconsider the meaning of
		  measurements and the structure of the space of
		  description.},
