  abstract	= {The industrial economy took shape between the late
		  eighteenth century and the nineteenth century, initially in
		  Western Europe and then in North America. Besides technical
		  production, it involves technological production – the
		  integration of sciences in order to produce indus-trial
		  goods –, to the strict extent that, as Marx showed,
		  capitalism makes knowledge and its economic valorization
		  its primary element. <br> Newton’s physics and the
		  metaphysics that goes with it originated the epistemic (in
		  Michel Foucault’s sense) and epistemological (in Gaston
		  Bachelard’s sense) framework of this great
		  transformation. In this transformation, otium (productive
		  leisure time) submits to negotium (worldly affairs,
		  business). All along, mathematics has been applied with
		  ever more powerful and performative calculating machines.
		  <br> After precursors such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen,
		  himself inspired by Alfred Lotka, we maintain that
		  political economy in what is now called the Anthropocene
		  (whose features were delineated by Vladimir Vernadsky in
		  1926) is a challenge that requires a fundamental
		  reconsideration of these epistemic frameworks and
		  epistemological frameworks. With Dar-win, living beings
		  became part of a historical process of becoming. In humans,
		  knowledge is a performative part of this process that
		  shapes and reshapes lifestyles in order to tame the im-pact
		  of technical novelties.},
