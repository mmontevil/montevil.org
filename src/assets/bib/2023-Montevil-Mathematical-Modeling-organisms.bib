  abstract	= {Mathematical modeling is a very powerful tool to
		  understand natural phenomena. Such a tool carries its own
		  assumptions and should always be used critically. In this
		  chapter we highlight the key ingredients and steps of
		  modeling and focus on their biological interpretation.
		  Particularly, we discuss the role of theoretical principles
		  in writing models. We also highlight the meaning and
		  interpretation of equations. The main aim of this chapter
		  is to facilitate the interaction between biologists and
		  mathematical modelers. We focus on the case of cell
		  proliferation and motility in the context of multicellular
		  organisms.},
