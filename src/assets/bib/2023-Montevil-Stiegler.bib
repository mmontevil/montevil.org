  abstract	= {"What I love, and those whom I love, you, that is to say
		  us in so far as we are capable of forming a we, all this I
		  love, and I love them, and I love you infinitely" (Bernard
		  Steigler April 1952- August 2020). <br> When Bernard
		  Stiegler writes "I love you" in the quote above, he openly
		  provokes us to question or experience the meaning or
		  contact of these words. He also invites us to question the
		  relationship between a thinker's life and their thought.
		  For Stiegler, they were inextricable. His life was one that
		  focused on friendship but not friendships at a purely
		  social level but ones that produced philosophy, politics,
		  and existential truths. <br> Bringing together scholars who
		  knew Stiegler, including Shaj Mohan, Achille Mbembe, Divya
		  Dwivedi, Peter Szendy, and Emily Apter, this volume
		  provides an original - and personal - insight into his life
		  and philosophy. Each piece gives a sense of the wide range
		  of Stiegler's work and how it affected the praxis of the
		  philosopher in different parts of the world.},

  abstract	= {The program Plaine Commune, contributive learning
		  territory, started in late 2016. It emerged from the
		  theoretical work of Bernard Stiegler and the Ars
		  Industrialis group. The contributive economy is a strategy
		  to disrupt technological disruption by developing knowledge
		  in all its forms. This program has led to several concrete
		  working groups in Plaine Commune, while others are still
		  developing. Mainly, work is taking place on the economy,
		  digital urbanism, and young children’s development in the
		  context of the overuse of digital media. Here, we focus on
		  the group on digital media and young children’s
		  development and how academics and inhabitant works
		  integrate.},
