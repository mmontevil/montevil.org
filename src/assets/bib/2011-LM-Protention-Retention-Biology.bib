  abstract	= {This article proposes an abstract mathematical frame for
		  describing some features of cognitive and biological time.
		  We focus here on the so called extended present as a result
		  of protentional and retentional activities (memory and
		  anticipation). Memory, as retention, is treated in some
		  physical theories (relaxation phenomena, which will inspire
		  our approach), while protention (or anticipation) seems
		  outside the scope of physics. We then suggest a simple
		  functional representation of biological protention. This
		  allows us to introduce the abstract notion of biological
		  inertia.},
