  abstract	= {Most mathematical modeling in biology relies either
		  implicitly or explicitly on the epistemology of physics.
		  The underlying conception is that the historicity of
		  biological objects would not matter to understand a
		  situation here and now, or, at least, historicity would not
		  impact the method of modeling. We analyze that it is not
		  the case with concrete examples. Historicity forces a
		  conceptual reconfiguration where equations no longer play a
		  central role. We argue that all observations depend on
		  objects defined by their historical origin instead of their
		  relations as in physics. Therefore, we propose that
		  biological variations and historicity come first, and
		  regularities are constraints with limited validity in
		  biology. Their proper theoretical and empirical use
		  requires specific rationales.},
