  abstract	= {Biologists increasingly report anthropogenic disruptions
		  of both organisms and ecosystems, suggesting that these
		  processes are a fundamental, qualitative component of the
		  Anthropocene crisis, seemingly generating disorder.
		  Nonetheless, the notion of disruption has not yet been
		  theorized as such in biology. To progress on this matter,
		  we build on a specific case. Relatively minor temperature
		  changes disrupt plant-pollinator synchrony, tearing apart
		  the web of life. Understanding this phenomenon requires a
		  specific rationale since models describing them use both
		  historical and systemic reasoning. Specifically, history
		  justifies that the system is initially in a narrow part of
		  the possibility space where it is viable, and the
		  disruption randomizes this configuration. Building on this
		  rationale, we develop a formal framework inspired by
		  Boltzmann's entropy. This framework defines the
		  randomization of the system and leads to analyze its
		  consequences systematically. Notably, maximum randomization
		  does not lead to the complete collapse of the ecosystem.
		  Moreover, pollinators' robustness mostly increases
		  viability for low randomizations, while resilience enhances
		  viability after high randomizations. Applying this
		  framework to empirical networks, we show historical trends
		  depending on latitude, providing further evidence of
		  climate change's impact on ecosystems via phenology
		  changes. These results lead to an initial definition of
		  disruption in ecology. When a specific historical outcome
		  contributes to a system's viability, disruption is the
		  randomization of this outcome, decreasing this viability.
