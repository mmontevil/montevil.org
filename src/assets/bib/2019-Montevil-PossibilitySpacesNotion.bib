  abstract	= {We provide a new perspective on the relation between the
		  space of description of an object and the appearance of
		  novelties. One of the aims of this perspective is to
		  facilitate the interaction between mathematics and
		  historical sciences. The definition of novelties is
		  paradoxical: if one can define in advance the possibles,
		  then they are not genuinely new. By analyzing the situation
		  in set theory, we show that defining generic (i.e., shared)
		  and specific (i.e., individual) properties of elements of a
		  set are radically different notions. As a result, generic
		  and specific definitions of possibilities cannot be
		  conflated. We argue that genuinely stating possibilities
		  requires that their meaning has to be made explicit. For
		  example, in physics, properties playing theoretical roles
		  are generic; then, generic reasoning is sufficient to
		  define possibilities. By contrast, in music, we argue that
		  specific properties matter, and generic definitions become
		  insufficient. Then, the notion of new possibilities becomes
		  relevant and irreducible. In biology, among other examples,
		  the generic definition of the space of DNA sequences is
		  insufficient to state phenotypic possibilities even if we
		  assume complete genetic determinism. The generic properties
		  of this space are relevant for sequencing or DNA
		  duplication, but they are inadequate to understand
		  phenotypes. We develop a strong concept of biological
		  novelties which justifies the notion of new possibilities
		  and is more robust than the notion of changing description
		  spaces. These biological novelties are not generic outcomes
		  from an initial situation. They are specific and this
		  specificity is associated with biological functions, that
		  is to say, with a specific causal structure. Thus, we think
		  that in contrast with physics, the concept of new
		  possibilities is necessary for biology.},
