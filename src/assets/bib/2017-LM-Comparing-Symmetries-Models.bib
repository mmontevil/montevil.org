  abstract	= {Computer simulations brought remarkable novelties to
		  knowledge construction. In this chapter, we first
		  distinguish between mathematical modeling, computer
		  implementations of these models and purely computational
		  approaches. In all three cases, different answers are
		  provided to the questions the observer may have concerning
		  the processes under investigation. These differences will
		  be highlighted by looking at the different theoretical
		  symmetries of each frame. In the latter case, the
		  peculiarities of agent-based or object oriented languages
		  allow to discuss the role of phase spaces in mathematical
		  analyses of physical versus biological dynamics. Symmetry
		  breaking and randomness are finally correlated in the
		  various contexts where they may be observed.},
