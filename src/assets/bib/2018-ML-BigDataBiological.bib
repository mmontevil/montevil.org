  abstract	= {Some authors assert that the analysis of huge databases
		  could replace the scientific method. On the contrary, we
		  argue that the best way to make these new technologies bear
		  fruits is to frame them with theories concerning the
		  phenomena of interest. Such theories hint to the observable
		  that should be taken into account and the mathematical
		  structures that may link them. In biology, we argue that
		  the community urgently needs an overarching theory of
		  organisms that would provide a precise framework to
		  understand lifecycles. Among other benefits, such a theory
		  should make explicit what we can and cannot predict in
		  principle.},
