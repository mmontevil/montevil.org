  abstract	= {The industrial economy took shape between the late
		  eighteenth century and the nineteenth century, initially in
		  Western Europe and then in North America. Besides technical
		  production, it involves technological production – the
		  integration of sciences in order to produce indus-trial
		  goods –, to the strict extent that, as Marx showed,
		  capitalism makes knowledge and its economic valorization
		  its primary element.
		  
		  Newton’s physics and the metaphysics that goes with it
		  originated the epistemic (in Michel Foucault’s sense) and
		  epistemological (in Gaston Bachelard’s sense) framework
		  of this great transformation. In this transformation, otium
		  (productive leisure time) submits to negotium (worldly
		  affairs, business). All along, mathematics has been applied
		  with ever more powerful and performative calculating
		  machines.
		  
		  After precursors such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, himself
		  inspired by Alfred Lotka, we maintain that political
		  economy in what is now called the Anthropocene (whose
		  features were delineated by Vladimir Vernadsky in 1926) is
		  a challenge that requires a fundamental reconsideration of
		  these epistemic frameworks and epistemological frameworks.
		  With Dar-win, living beings became part of a historical
		  process of becoming. In humans, knowledge is a performative
		  part of this process that shapes and reshapes lifestyles in
		  order to tame the im-pact of technical novelties.},
