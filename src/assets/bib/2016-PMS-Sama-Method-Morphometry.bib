  abstract	= {Three-dimensional (3D) culture models are critical tools
		  for understanding tissue morphogenesis. A key requirement
		  for their analysis is the ability to reconstruct the tissue
		  into computational models that allow quantitative
		  evaluation of the formed structures. Here, we present
		  Software for Automated Morphological Analysis (SAMA), a
		  method by which epithelial structures grown in 3D cultures
		  can be imaged, reconstructed and analyzed with minimum
		  human intervention. SAMA allows quantitative analysis of
		  key features of epithelial morphogenesis such as ductal
		  elongation, branching and lumen formation that distinguish
		  different hormonal treatments. SAMA is a user-friendly set
		  of customized macros operated via FIJI
		  (http://fiji.sc/Fiji), an open-source image analysis
		  platform in combination with a set of functions in R
		  (http://www.r-project.org/), an open-source program for
		  statistical analysis. SAMA enables a rapid, exhaustive and
		  quantitative 3D analysis of the shape of a population of
		  structures in a 3D image. SAMA is cross-platform, licensed
		  under the GPLv3 and available at
		  http://montevil.theobio.org/content/sama.},
