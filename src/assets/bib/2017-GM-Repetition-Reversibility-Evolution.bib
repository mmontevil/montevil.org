  abstract	= {Repetitiveness and reversibility have long been considered
		  as characteristic features of scientific knowledge. In
		  theoretical population genetics, repetitiveness is
		  illustrated by a number of genetic equilibria realized
		  under specific conditions. Since these equilibria are
		  maintained despite a continual flux of changes in the
		  course of generations (reshuffling of genes,
		  reproduction{\ldots}), it can legitimately be said that
		  population genetics reveals important properties of
		  invariance through transformation. Time-reversibility is a
		  more controversial subject. Here, the parallel with
		  classical mechanics is much weaker. Time-reversibility is
		  unquestionable in some stochastic models, but at the cost
		  of a special, probabilistic concept of reversibility. But
		  it does not seem to be a property of the most basic
		  deterministic models describing the dynamics of
		  evolutionary change at the level of populations and genes.
		  Furthermore, various meanings of `reversibility' are
		  distinguished. In particular, time-reversibility should not
		  be confused with retrodictability.},
