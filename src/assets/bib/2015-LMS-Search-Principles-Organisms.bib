  abstract	= {Lacking an operational theory to explain the organization
		  and behaviour of matter in unicellular and multicellular
		  organisms hinders progress in biology. Such a theory should
		  address life cycles from ontogenesis to death. This theory
		  would complement the theory of evolution that addresses
		  phylogenesis, and would posit theoretical extensions to
		  accepted physical principles and default states in order to
		  grasp the living state of matter and define proper
		  biological observables. Thus, we favour adopting the
		  default state implicit in Darwin's theory, namely, cell
		  proliferation with variation plus motility, and a framing
		  principle, namely, life phenomena manifest themselves as
		  non-identical iterations of morphogenetic processes. From
		  this perspective, organisms become a consequence of the
		  inherent variability generated by proliferation, motility
		  and self-organization. Morphogenesis would then be the
		  result of the default state plus physical constraints, like
		  gravity, and those present in living organisms, like
		  muscular tension.},
