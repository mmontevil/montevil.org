  abstract	= {In this article, we discuss the perspective of
		  intraorganismal ecology by investigating a family of
		  ecological models. We consider two types of models.
		  First-order models describe the population dynamics as
		  being directly affected by ecological factors (here
		  understood as nutrients, space, etc). They might be thought
		  of as analogous to Aristotelian physics. Second-order
		  models describe the population dynamics as being indirectly
		  affected, the ecological factors now affecting the
		  derivative of the growth rate (that is, the population
		  acceleration), possibly through an impact on nongenetically
		  inherited factors. Second-order models might be thought of
		  as analogous to Galilean physics. In a companion article,
		  we apply these ideas to a situation of gene therapy.},
