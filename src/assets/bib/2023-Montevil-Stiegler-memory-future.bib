  abstract	= {The program Plaine Commune, contributive learning
		  territory, started in late 2016. It emerged from the
		  theoretical work of Bernard Stiegler and the Ars
		  Industrialis group. The contributive economy is a strategy
		  to disrupt technological disruption by developing knowledge
		  in all its forms. This program has led to several concrete
		  working groups in Plaine Commune, while others are still
		  developing. Mainly, work is taking place on the economy,
		  digital urbanism, and young children’s development in the
		  context of the overuse of digital media. Here, we focus on
		  the group on digital media and young children’s
		  development and how academics and inhabitant works
		  integrate.},
