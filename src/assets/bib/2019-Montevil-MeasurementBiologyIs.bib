  abstract	= {We characterize access to empirical objects in biology
		  from a theoretical perspective. Unlike objects in current
		  physical theories, biological objects are the result of a
		  history and their variations continue to generate a
		  history. This property is the starting point of our concept
		  of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is
		  relative to a natural history which is shared by the
		  different objects subjected to the measurement and is more
		  or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization
		  the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to
		  considering biological objects as equivalent in a
		  measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to
		  analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring
		  biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by
		  studying objects as similar as possible, while others build
		  on biological diversity.},
