  abstract	= {This paper proposes an abstract mathematical frame for
		  describing some features of biological time. The key point
		  is that usual physical (linear) representation of time is
		  insufficient, in our view, for the understanding key
		  phenomena of life, such as rhythms, both physical
		  (circadian, seasonal …) and properly biological (heart
		  beating, respiration, metabolic …). In particular, the
		  role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any
		  counterpart in mathematical formalization of physical
		  clocks, which are based on frequencies along the usual
		  (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then
		  suggest a functional representation of biological time by a
		  2-dimensional manifold as a mathematical frame for
		  accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The
		  “visual” representation of rhythms so obtained, in
		  particular heart beatings, will provide, by a few examples,
		  hints towards possible applications of our approach to the
		  understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific
		  pathologies. The 3- dimensional embedding space, needed for
		  purely mathematical reasons, allows to introduce a suitable
		  extra-dimension for “representation time”, with a
		  cognitive significance.},
