  abstract	= {Abstract Darwin introduced the concept that random
		  variation generates new living forms. In this paper, we
		  elaborate on Darwin's notion of random variation to propose
		  that biological variation should be given the status of a
		  fundamental theoretical principle in biology. We state that
		  biological objects such as organisms are specific objects.
		  Specific objects are special in that they are qualitatively
		  different from each other. They can undergo unpredictable
		  qualitative changes, some of which are not defined before
		  they happen. We express the principle of variation in terms
		  of symmetry changes, where symmetries underlie the
		  theoretical determination of the object. We contrast the
		  biological situation with the physical situation, where
		  objects are generic (that is, different objects can be
		  assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-defined state
		  spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of
		  variation, in particular, biological objects show
		  randomness, historicity and contextuality. We elaborate on
		  the articulation between this principle and the two other
		  principles proposed in this special issue: the principle of
		  default state and the principle of organization.},
