  abstract	= {In this text, we revisit part of the analysis of
		  anti-entropy in [4] and develop further theoretical
		  reflections. In particular, we analyze how randomness, an
		  essential component of biological variability, is
		  associated to the growth of biological organization, both
		  in ontogenesis and in evolution. This approach, in
		  particular, focuses on the role of global entropy
		  production and provides a tool for a mathematical
		  understanding of some fundamental observations by Gould on
		  the increasing phenotypic complexity along evolution.
		  Lastly, we analyze the situation in terms of theoretical
		  symmetries, in order to further specify the biological
		  meaning of anti-entropy as well as its strong link with
		  randomness.},
