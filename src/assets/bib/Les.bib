  abstract	= {Unlike inert objects, organisms and their cells have the
		  ability to initiate activity by themselves, and thus change
		  their properties or states even in the absence of an
		  external cause. This crucial difference led us to search
		  for principles suitable for the study organisms. We propose
		  that cells follow the default state of proliferation with
		  variation and motility, a principle of biological inertia.
		  This means that in the presence of sufficient nutrients,
		  cells will express their default state. We also propose a
		  principle of variation that addresses two central features
		  of organisms, variation and historicity. To address
		  interdependence between parts, we use a third principle,
		  the principle of organization: more specifically, the
		  notion of the closure of constraints. Within this
		  theoretical framework, constraints are specific theoretical
		  entities defined by their relative stability with respect
		  to the processes they constrain. Constraints are mutually
		  dependent in an organized system and act on the default
		  state. <br>
		  
		  Here we discuss the application and articulation of these
		  principles for mathematical modeling of morphogenesis in a
		  specific case, that of mammary ductal morphogenesis, with
		  an emphasis on the default state. Our model has both a
		  biological component, the cells, and a physical component,
		  the matrix that contains collagen fibers. Cells are agents
		  that move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert
		  mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on
		  other cells. As fibers are organized, they constrain the
		  cells’ ability to move and to proliferate. This model
		  exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of
		  the closure of constraints. Implementing our mathematical
		  model shows that constraints to the default state are
		  sufficient to explain the formation of mammary epithelial
		  structures. Finally, the success of this modeling effort
		  suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional
		  constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism can be
		  examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and in
		  vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist
		  perspective we embrace.},

		  phylogenesis, and would posit theoretical extensions to
		  accepted physical principles and default states in order to
		  grasp the living state of matter and define proper

		  default state implicit in Darwin's theory, namely, cell
		  proliferation with variation plus motility, and a framing
		  principle, namely, life phenomena manifest themselves as
		  non-identical iterations of morphogenetic processes. From
		  this perspective, organisms become a consequence of the
		  inherent variability generated by proliferation, motility
		  and self-organization. Morphogenesis would then be the
		  result of the default state plus physical constraints, like
		  gravity, and those present in living organisms, like
		  muscular tension.},

		  objects are generic (that is, different objects can be
		  assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-defined state
		  spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of
		  variation, in particular, biological objects show

  abstract	= {Abstract In multicellular organisms, relations among parts
		  and between parts and the whole are contextual and
		  interdependent. These organisms and their cells are
		  ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that
		  divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in
		  tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and
		  cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This
		  contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to
		  establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we
		  propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic
		  difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an
		  experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to
		  obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts
		  and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological
		  principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling
		  in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts
		  developed originally in physics or computer sciences.
		  Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based
		  on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use
		  principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of
		  a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell
		  proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the
		  principle of organization by closure of constraints. This
		  model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical
		  component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells
		  display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained;
		  they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers
		  and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain
		  the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The
		  model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in
		  terms of closure of constraints. Implementing the
		  mathematical model shows that constraints to the default
		  state are sufficient to explain ductal and acinar
		  formation, and points to a target of future research,
		  namely, to inhibitors of cell proliferation and motility
		  generated by the epithelial cells. The success of this
		  model suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional
		  constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism could be
		  examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and
		  in vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist
		  perspective we embrace.},
