  abstract	= {This short text summarizes the work in biology proposed in
		  our book, Perspectives on Organisms, where we analyse the
		  unity proper to organisms by looking at it from different
		  viewpoints. We discuss the theoretical roles of biological
		  time, complexity, theoretical symmetries, singularities and
		  critical transitions. We explicitly borrow from the
		  conclusions in some key chapters and introduce them by a
		  reflection on "incompleteness", also proposed in the book.
		  We consider that incompleteness is a fundamental notion to
		  understand the way in which we construct knowledge. Then we
		  will introduce an approach to biological dynamics where
		  randomness is central to the theoretical determination:
		  randomness does not oppose biological stability but
		  contributes to it by variability, adaptation, and
		  diversity. Then, evolutionary and ontogenetic trajectories
		  are continual changes of coherence structures involving
		  symmetry changes within an ever-changing global
		  stability.},
