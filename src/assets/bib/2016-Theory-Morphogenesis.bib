  abstract	= {We developed 3D culture methods that reproduce in vitro
		  mammary gland ductal morphogenesis. We are proposing a
		  conceptual framework to understand morphogenetic events
		  based on epistemologically sound biological principles
		  instead of the common practice of using only physical
		  principles. More specifically, our theoretical framework is
		  based on the principle that the default state of cells is
		  proliferation with variation and motility. We emphasize the
		  role played by the agency of cells embedded in a gel and
		  the circularity that is relevant for the intended process,
		  whereby cells act upon other cells and on matrix elements,
		  and are subject to the agentivity of neighboring cells.
		  This circularity strongly differs from classical linear
		  causality. Finally, our approach opens up the study of
		  causal determination to multilevel explanations rather than
		  to reductive ones involving only molecules in general and
		  genes in particular.},
