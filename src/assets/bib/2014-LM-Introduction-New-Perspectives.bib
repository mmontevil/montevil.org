  abstract	= {This note introduces recent work in Theoretical Biology by
		  borrowing from the Introduction (chapter 1) of the book by
		  the authors: "Perspectives on Organisms: Biological Time,
		  Symmetries and Singularities", Springer, 2014. The idea is
		  to work towards a Theory of Organisms analogue and along
		  the Theory of Evolution, where ontogenesis could be
		  considered as part of phylogenesis. As a matter of fact,
		  the latter is made out of "segments" of the first:
		  phylogenesis is the "sum" of ontogenetic paths and they
		  should be made intelligible by similar principles. To this
		  aim, we look at ontogenesis from different perspectives. By
		  this, we shed light on the unity of the organism from
		  different points of view, yet constantly keeping that unity
		  as a core invariant. The analysis of invariance, as the
		  result of theoretical symmetries, and of symmetry changes,
		  is a key theme of the approach in the book and in the
		  discussion in this note.},
