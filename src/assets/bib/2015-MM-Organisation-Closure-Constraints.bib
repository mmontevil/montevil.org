  abstract	= {We propose a conceptual and formal characterisation of
		  biological organisation as a closure of constraints. We
		  first establish a distinction between two causal regimes at
		  work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the
		  whole set of changes occurring in non-equilibrium open
		  thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities
		  which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form
		  of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We
		  then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise
		  closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend
		  on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this
		  characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational
		  closure can provide an operational tool for marking the
		  boundaries between interacting biological systems. We
		  conclude by focusing on the original conception of the
		  relationship between stability and variation which emerges
		  from this framework.},
