  abstract	= {Abstract In the search of a theory of biological
		  organisms, we propose to adopt organization as a
		  theoretical principle. Organization constitutes an
		  overarching hypothesis that frames the intelligibility of
		  biological objects, by characterizing their relevant
		  aspects. After a succinct historical survey on the
		  understanding of organization in the organicist tradition,
		  we offer a specific characterization in terms of closure of
		  constraints. We then discuss some implications of the
		  adoption of organization as a principle and, in particular,
		  we focus on how it fosters an original approach to
		  biological stability, as well as and its interplay with
		  variation.},
