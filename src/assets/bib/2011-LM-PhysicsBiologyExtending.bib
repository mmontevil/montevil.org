  abstract	= {Symmetries play a major role in physics, in particular
		  since the work by E. Noether and H. Weyl in the first half
		  of last century. Herein, we briefly review their role by
		  recalling how symmetry changes allow to conceptually move
		  from classical to relativistic and quantum physics. We then
		  introduce our ongoing theoretical analysis in biology and
		  show that symmetries play a radically different role in
		  this discipline, when compared to those in current physics.
		  By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be
		  understood in relation to conservation and stability
		  properties, as represented in the theories. We posit that
		  the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various
		  levels of organization, are not just processes, but
		  permanent (extended, in our terminology) critical
		  transitions and, thus, symmetry changes. Within the limits
		  of a relative structural stability (or interval of
		  viability), variability is at the core of these
		  transitions.},
