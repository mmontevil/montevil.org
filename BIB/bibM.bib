  abstract  = {What do mainstream scientists acknowledge as original scientific contributions? In other words, what is the current épistémè in natural sciences? This essay attempts to characterize this épistémè as computational empiricism. Scientific works are primarily empirical, generating data and computational, to analyze them and reproduce them with models. This épistémè values primarily the investigation of specific phenomena and thus leads to the fragmentation of sciences. It also promotes attention-catching results showing limits of earlier theories. However, it consumes these theories since it does not renew them, leading more and more fields to be in a state of theory disruption.},

journal = { },
year = {submitted},
abstract = {Biologists increasingly report anthropogenic disruptions of both organisms and ecosystems, suggesting that these processes are a fundamental, qualitative component of the Anthropocene crisis, seemingly generating disorder. Nonetheless, the notion of disruption has not yet been theorized as such in biology. To progress on this matter, we build on a specific case. Relatively minor temperature changes disrupt plant-pollinator synchrony, tearing apart the web of life. Understanding this phenomenon requires a specific rationale since models describing them use both historical and systemic reasoning. Specifically, history justifies that the system is initially in a narrow part of the possibility space where it is viable, and the disruption randomizes this configuration. Building on this rationale, we develop a formal framework inspired by Boltzmann's entropy. This framework defines the randomization of the system and leads to analyze its consequences systematically. Notably, maximum randomization does not lead to the complete collapse of the ecosystem. Moreover, pollinators' robustness mostly increases viability for low randomizations, while resilience enhances viability after high randomizations. Applying this framework to empirical networks, we show historical trends depending on latitude, providing further evidence of climate change's impact on ecosystems via phenology changes. These results lead to an initial definition of disruption in ecology.  When a specific historical outcome contributes to a system's viability, disruption is the randomization of this outcome,  decreasing this viability. },

for the intended process, whereby cells act upon other cells

classical linear causality. Finally, our approach opens up
the study of causal determination to multilevel explanations

We argue that all observations depend on objects defined by their historical origin instead of their relations as in physics.

  abstract= {Technological developments in genomics and other -omics originated the idea that precise measurements would lead to better therapeutic strategies. However, precision does not entail accuracy. Scientific accuracy requires a theoretical framework to understand the meaning of measurements, the nature of causal relationships, and potential intrinsic limitations of knowledge. For example, a precise measurement of initial positions in classical mechanics is useless without initial velocities; it is not an accurate measurement of the initial condition. Conceptual and theoretical accuracy is required for precision to lead to the progress of knowledge and rationality in action. In the search for accuracy in medicine, we first outline our results on a theory of organisms. Biology is distinct from physics and requires a specific epistemology. In particular, we develop the meaning of biological measurements and emphasize that variability and historicity are fundamental notions. However, medicine is not just biology; we articulate the historicity of biological norms that stems from evolution and the idea that patients and groups of patients generate new norms to overcome pathological situations. Patients then play an active role, in line with the philosophy of Georges Canguilhem. We argue that taking this dimension of medicine into account is critical for theoretical accuracy.},

Such a theory should address life cycles from ontogenesis to death. This theory would complement the theory of evolution that addresses phylogenesis, and would posit theoretical extensions to accepted physical principles and default states in order to grasp the living state of matter and define proper biological observables. Thus, we favour adopting the default state implicit in Darwin's theory, namely, cell proliferation with variation plus motility, and a framing principle, namely, life phenomena manifest themselves as non-identical iterations of morphogenetic processes. From this perspective, organisms become a consequence of the inherent variability generated by proliferation, motility and self-organization. Morphogenesis would then be the result of the default state plus physical constraints, like gravity, and those present in living organisms, like muscular tension.},

  The Anthropocene crisis is frequently described as the rarefaction of resources or resources per capita. However, both energy and minerals correspond to fundamentally conserved quantities from the perspective of physics. A specific concept is required to understand the rarefaction of available resources. This concept, entropy, pertains to energy and matter configurations and not just to their sheer amount.  
 <br>
However, the physics concept of entropy is insufficient to understand biological and social organizations. Biological phenomena display both historicity and systemic properties. A biological organization, the ability of a specific living being to last over time, results from history, expresses itself by systemic properties, and may require generating novelties The concept of anti-entropy stems from the combination of these features. We propose that Anthropocene changes disrupt biological organizations by randomizing them, that is, decreasing anti-entropy. Moreover, second-order disruptions correspond to the decline of the ability to produce functional novelties, that is, to produce anti-entropy.

Besides technical production, it involves technological production – the integration of sciences in order to produce indus-trial goods –, to the strict extent that, as Marx showed, capitalism makes knowledge and its economic valorization its primary element.
    <br>
    Newton’s physics and the metaphysics that goes with it originated the epistemic (in Michel Foucault’s sense) and epistemological (in Gaston Bachelard’s sense) framework of this great transformation. In this transformation, otium (productive leisure time) submits to negotium (worldly affairs, business). All along, mathematics has been applied with ever more powerful and performative calculating machines.
    <br>
    After precursors such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, himself inspired by Alfred Lotka, we maintain that political economy in what is now called the Anthropocene (whose features were delineated by Vladimir Vernadsky in 1926) is a challenge that requires a fundamental reconsideration of these epistemic frameworks and epistemological frameworks. With Dar-win, living beings became part of a historical process of becoming. In humans, knowledge is a performative part of this process that shapes and reshapes lifestyles in order to tame the im-pact of technical novelties.},

Outre les productions techniques, elle aura conduit à des productions technologiques – mobilisant des sciences pour produire des biens industriels – : comme Marx l'aura montré en 1857, le capitalisme fait du savoir et de sa valorisation économique son élément premier.
<br>
La physique de Newton et la métaphysique qui l'accompagne sont à l'origine du cadre épistémique (au sens de Michel Foucault) et épistémologique (au sens de Gaston Bachelard) de cette grande transformation – qui est la condition de ce que Karl Polanyi appellera lui-même « la grande transformation ». Dans cette transformation, l'otium (le temps de loisirs productifs) se soumet au negotium (les affaires du monde). Pendant ce temps, les mathématiques sont appliquées à travers des machines à calculer toujours plus puissantes et performatives – appelées computers après la deuxième guerre mondiale.

Après des précurseurs tels que Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, lui-même inspiré par Alfred Lotka, nous soutiendrons dans le présent ouvrage que l'économie politique, dans ce qui est appelé l'ère Anthropocène (thématisée en 2000 par Paul Krutzen, et dont les caractéristiques ont été décrites par Vladimir Vernadsky dès 19263) est un défi qui nécessite un réexamen fondamental de ces cadres épistémiques et épistémologiques.

Ce processus devient exosomatique, c’est à dire extra-corporel, comme le montre Lotka, qui façonne et remodèle les modes de vie afin, notamment, de limiter les effets négatifs des nouveautés techniques.},

Faced with the diversity of the living and faced with the internal heterogeneity of organisms, the human mind can sometimes seem a bit powerless. The contemporary possibility of developing immense digital databases, collaboratively, therefore appears as a major opportunity. The application of big data to cancer is done within a specific theoretical framework, in which the carcinogenesis process is conceived as the appearance of cancerous cells through the accumulation of somatic mutations. Mathematics allows us to demonstrate the limits of these purely algorithmic methods by showing the impossibility of replacing the scientific quest for meaning with pure “data mining”. Theorems at the crossroads between ergodic theory and the Ramsey theory, a combinatory theory of numbers proposed in the 1920s and significantly developed since, contradict this use of Big Data.},

  abstract  = {Summary This chapter briefly presents and describes the three main principles that the group proposes for a theory of organisms, namely: the default state, proliferation with variation and motility, the principle of variation and the principle of organization. It is crucial to critique the philosophical and theoretical position on which the biological research feeding into the program is based and which has dominated biomedical research for the last 70 years. Physical theories are founded on stable mathematical structures, based onregularities and especially on theoretical symmetries. At the time of cell theory formulation and still today, cell theory plays a federating role between evolution biology and organism biology. Finally, analysis of the differences between the physics of inanimate and living matter leads to the proposal of three principles that provide aviable perspective for the construction of a necessary theory of organisms.},

We first examine the central tenets of two general conceptions, and we assess their respective strengths and weaknesses. The historical conception, on the one hand, characterizes organisms' identity by looking at their past, and specifically at their genealogical connection with a common ancestor. The relational conception, on the other hand, interprets organisms' identity by referring to a set of distinctive relations between their parts, and between the organism and its environment. While the historical and relational conceptions are understood as opposed and conflicting, we submit that they are also fundamentally complementary. Accordingly, we put forward a hybrid conception, in which historical and relational (and more specifically, organizational) aspects of organisms' identity sustain and justify each other. Moreover, we argue that organisms' identity is not only hybrid but also bounded, insofar as the compliance with specific identity criteria tends to vanish as time passes, especially across generations. We spell out the core conceptual framework of this conception, and we outline an original formal representation. We contend that the hybrid and bounded conception of organisms' identity suits the epistemological needs of biological practices, particularly with regards to the generalization and reproducibility of experimental results, and the integration of mathematical models with experiments.},

Instead, theoretical biology should strive to find suitable first principles to ground the understanding of biological phenomena and ultimately frame biological experiments and mathematical models. First principles in physics are expressed in terms of symmetries and the associated conservations, on the one side, and optimization on the other side.  In biology, we argue instead that a strong notion of variation is fundamental. This notion encompasses new possibilities and the historicity of biological phenomena. By contrast, the relative regularity of some aspects of biological organisms, which we call constraints, should be regarded as the consequence of a mutual stabilization of the parts of organisms. We exemplify several aspects of this framework with the modeling of allometric relationships. Our change of perspective leads to reconsider the meaning of measurements and the structure of the space of description.},

Recently two critics have argued that toft and smt, despite their apparent strong incompatibilities, are actually compatible. Here we review their arguments. We show that these arguments are based on interpretation mistakes that become understandable once one grants that criticizing a paradigm from the point of view of another, in which words do not have the same signification, bears the risk of strong misunderstandings. These misunderstandings, in our experience, are common. We hope that this discussion will help clarifying the differences between toft and smt.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The principle of inertia is central to the modern scientific revolution. By postulating this principle Galileo at once identified a pertinent physical observable (momentum) and a conservation law (momentum conservation). He then could scientifically analyze what modifies inertial movement: gravitation and friction. Inertia, the default state in mechanics, represented a major theoretical commitment: there is no need to explain uniform rectilinear motion, rather, there is a need to explain departures from it. By analogy, we propose a biological default state of proliferation with variation and motility. From this theoretical commitment, what requires explanation is proliferative quiescence, lack of variation, lack of movement. That proliferation is the default state is axiomatic for biologists studying unicellular organisms. Moreover, it is implied in Darwin's “descent with modification”. Although a “default state” is a theoretical construct and a limit case that does not need to be instantiated, conditions that closely resemble unrestrained cell proliferation are readily obtained experimentally. We will illustrate theoretical and experimental consequences of applying and of ignoring this principle.},

In this paper, we elaborate on Darwin's notion of random variation to propose that biological variation should be given the status of a fundamental theoretical principle in biology. We state that biological objects such as organisms are specific objects. Specific objects are special in that they are qualitatively different from each other. They can undergo unpredictable qualitative changes, some of which are not defined before they happen. We express the principle of variation in terms of symmetry changes, where symmetries underlie the theoretical determination of the object. We contrast the biological situation with the physical situation, where objects are generic (that is, different objects can be assumed to be identical) and evolve in well-defined state spaces. We derive several implications of the principle of variation, in particular, biological objects show randomness, historicity and contextuality. We elaborate on the articulation between this principle and the two other principles proposed in this special issue: the principle of default state and the principle of organization.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In multicellular organisms, relations among parts and between parts and the whole are contextual and interdependent. These organisms and their cells are ontogenetically linked: an organism starts as a cell that divides producing non-identical cells, which organize in tri-dimensional patterns. These association patterns and cells types change as tissues and organs are formed. This contextuality and circularity makes it difficult to establish detailed cause and effect relationships. Here we propose an approach to overcome these intrinsic difficulties by combining the use of two models; 1) an experimental one that employs 3D culture technology to obtain the structures of the mammary gland, namely, ducts and acini, and 2) a mathematical model based on biological principles. The typical approach for mathematical modeling in biology is to apply mathematical tools and concepts developed originally in physics or computer sciences. Instead, we propose to construct a mathematical model based on proper biological principles. Specifically, we use principles identified as fundamental for the elaboration of a theory of organisms, namely i) the default state of cell proliferation with variation and motility and ii) the principle of organization by closure of constraints. This model has a biological component, the cells, and a physical component, a matrix which contains collagen fibers. Cells display agency and move and proliferate unless constrained; they exert mechanical forces that i) act on collagen fibers and ii) on other cells. As fibers organize, they constrain the cells on their ability to move and to proliferate. The model exhibits a circularity that can be interpreted in terms of closure of constraints. Implementing the mathematical model shows that constraints to the default state are sufficient to explain ductal and acinar formation, and points to a target of future research, namely, to inhibitors of cell proliferation and motility generated by the epithelial cells. The success of this model suggests a step-wise approach whereby additional constraints imposed by the tissue and the organism could be examined in silico and rigorously tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments, in accordance with the organicist perspective we embrace.},

  abstract  = {We provide a new perspective on the relation between the space of description of an object and the appearance of novelties. One of the aims of this perspective is to facilitate the interaction between mathematics and historical sciences. The definition of novelties is paradoxical: if one can define in advance the possibles, then they are not genuinely new. By analyzing the situation in set theory, we show that defining generic (i.e., shared) and specific (i.e., individual) properties of elements of a set are radically different notions. As a result, generic and specific definitions of possibilities cannot be conflated. We argue that genuinely stating possibilities requires that their meaning has to be made explicit. For example, in physics, properties playing theoretical roles are generic; then, generic reasoning is sufficient to define possibilities. By contrast, in music, we argue that specific properties matter, and generic definitions become insufficient. Then, the notion of new possibilities becomes relevant and irreducible. In biology, among other examples, the generic definition of the space of DNA sequences is insufficient to state phenotypic possibilities even if we assume complete genetic determinism. The generic properties of this space are relevant for sequencing or DNA duplication, but they are inadequate to understand phenotypes. We develop a strong concept of biological novelties which justifies the notion of new possibilities and is more robust than the notion of changing description spaces. These biological novelties are not generic outcomes from an initial situation. They are specific and this specificity is associated with biological functions, that is to say, with a specific causal structure. Thus, we think that in contrast with physics, the concept of new possibilities is necessary for biology.},

  abstract  = {La répétitivité et la réversibilité ont longtemps été considérées comme des traits caractéristiques de la connaissance scientifique. Dans la génétique des populations, la répétitivité est illustrée par un certain nombre d'équilibres réalisés dans des conditions spécifiques. Étant donné que ces équilibres sont maintenus en dépit du renouvellement des générations (réarrangement de gènes, reproduction ...), on peut légitimement dire que la génétique des populations révèle d'importantes propriétés d'invariance par transformation. La réversibilité est un sujet plus controversé. Ici, le parallèle avec la mécanique classique est beaucoup plus faible. La réversibilité est incontestable dans certains modèles stochastiques, mais au prix d'un concept probabiliste particulier de réversibilité. Par contre, elle ne semble pas être une propriété de la plupart des modèles déterministes classiques décrivant la dynamique des changements évolutifs au niveau des populations. Nous distinguons plusieurs sens de la « réversibilité ». En particulier, la symétrie par inversion du temps ne doit pas être confondue avec la rétrodiction.},

  abstract  = {Repetitiveness and reversibility have long been considered as characteristic features of scientific knowledge. In theoretical population genetics, repetitiveness is illustrated by a number of genetic equilibria realized under specific conditions. Since these equilibria are maintained despite a continual flux of changes in the course of generations (reshuffling of genes, reproduction{\ldots}), it can legitimately be said that population genetics reveals important properties of invariance through transformation. Time-reversibility is a more controversial subject. Here, the parallel with classical mechanics is much weaker. Time-reversibility is unquestionable in some stochastic models, but at the cost of a special, probabilistic concept of reversibility. But it does not seem to be a property of the most basic deterministic models describing the dynamics of evolutionary change at the level of populations and genes. Furthermore, various meanings of `reversibility' are distinguished. In particular, time-reversibility should not be confused with retrodictability.},

We first establish a distinction between two causal regimes at work in biological systems: processes, which refer to the whole set of changes occurring in non-equilibrium open thermodynamic conditions; and constraints, those entities which, while acting upon the processes, exhibit some form of conservation (symmetry) at the relevant time scales. We then argue that, in biological systems, constraints realise closure, i.e. mutual dependence such that they both depend on and contribute to maintaining each other. With this characterisation in hand, we discuss how organisational closure can provide an operational tool for marking the boundaries between interacting biological systems. We conclude by focusing on the original conception of the relationship between stability and variation which emerges from this framework.},

The key point is that usual physical (linear) representation of time is insufficient, in our view, for the understanding key phenomena of life, such as rhythms, both physical (circadian, seasonal …) and properly biological (heart beating, respiration, metabolic …). In particular, the role of biological rhythms do not seem to have any counterpart in mathematical formalization of physical clocks, which are based on frequencies along the usual (possibly thermodynamical, thus oriented) time. We then suggest a functional representation of biological time by a 2-dimensional manifold as a mathematical frame for accommodating autonomous biological rhythms. The “visual” representation of rhythms so obtained, in particular heart beatings, will provide, by a few examples, hints towards possible applications of our approach to the understanding of interspecific differences or intraspecific pathologies. The 3- dimensional embedding space, needed for purely mathematical reasons, allows to introduce a suitable extra-dimension for “representation time”, with a cognitive significance.},

  abstract  = {Background: Mammary gland morphogenesis involves ductal elongation, branching, and budding. All of these processes are mediated by stroma - epithelium interactions. Biomechanical factors, such as matrix stiffness, have been established as important factors in these interactions. For example, epithelial cells fail to form normal acinar structures in vitro in 3D gels that exceed the stiffness of a normal mammary gland. Additionally, heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of acini and ducts within individual collagen gels suggests that local organization of the matrix may guide morphogenesis. Here, we quantified the effects of both bulk material stiffness and local collagen fiber arrangement on epithelial morphogenesis.
    Results: The formation of ducts and acini from single cells and the reorganization of the collagen fiber network were quantified using time-lapse confocal microscopy. MCF10A cells organized the 
    surrounding collagen fibers during the first twelve hours after seeding. Collagen fiber density and alignment relative to the epithelial surface significantly increased within the first twelve hours and were a major influence in the shaping of the mammary epithelium. The addition of Matrigel to the collagen fiber network impaired cell-mediated reorganization of the matrix and increased the probability of spheroidal acini rather than branching ducts. The mechanical anisotropy created by regions of highly aligned collagen fibers facilitated elongation and branching, which was significantly correlated with fiber organization. In contrast, changes in bulk stiffness were not a strong predictor of this epithelial morphology. Conclusions: Localized regions of collagen fiber alignment are required for ductal elongation and branching suggesting the importance of local mechanical anisotropy in mammary epithelial morphogenesis. Similar principles may govern the morphology of branching 
    and budding in other tissues and organs.},

Starting point is the investigation of empirical biological scaling including their variability, which is found in the literature, e.g. allometric relationships, fractals, etc. The book then analyzes two different aspects of biological time: first, a supplementary temporal dimension to accommodate proper biological rhythms; secondly, the concepts of protension and retention as a means of local organization of time in living organisms. Moreover, the book investigates the role of symmetry in biology, in view of its ubiquitous importance in physics. In relation with the notion of extended critical transitions, the book proposes that organisms and their evolution can be characterized by continued symmetry changes, which accounts for the irreducibility of their historicity and variability. The authors also introduce the concept of anti-entropy as a measure for the potential of variability, being equally understood as alterations in symmetry. By this, the book provides a mathematical account of Gould's analysis of phenotypic complexity with respect to biological evolution. The target audience primarily comprises researchers interested in new theoretical approaches to biology, from physical, biological or philosophical backgrounds, but the book may also be beneficial for graduate students who want to enter this field.},

Pour cela, nous rapportons les possibles symétries et invariants biologiques sous forme de “lois d'échelles” empiriques (allométrie et fractales en particulier), ainsi que la variabilité associée. Nous abordons ensuite plusieurs aspects du temps biologique.  Nous considérons  une dimension temporelle supplémentaire, correspondant à l'autonomie de certains rythmes biologiques. Nous développons aussi une approche de la protension, comme principe d'organisation locale de la temporalité biologique.<br>
La notion de symétrie ayant un statut fondationel pour les théories physiques, nous interrogeons ensuite leur rôles en biologie. Partant de la notion de criticité étendue, nous proposons que la dynamique du vivant  soit régie par une omniprésence des changements de symétries,  constituant dès lors une historicité irréductible et conférant un statut théorique particulier à l'object et à la mesure en biologie. Nous appréhendons aussi la notion d'anti-entropie comme mesure d'un potentiel de variabilité.<br>
Nous nous intéressons ensuite à la question des niveaux d'organisation, par deux voies complémentaires. Nous l'abordons dans un premier temps par la notion de clôture organisationnelle. Ensuite nous la considérons comme associée à des singularités fortes, telles que dans les situations critiques. Enfin, nous esquissons un schème opératoriel de l'unité de l'organisme, qui combine un grand nombre des aspects préalablement exposés.},

By this comparison, we stress that symmetries must be understood in relation to conservation and stability properties, as represented in the theories. We posit that the dynamics of biological organisms, in their various levels of organization, are not just processes, but permanent (extended, in our terminology) critical transitions and, thus, symmetry changes.

    structural stability, variability and emergence of new phe-
    notypes, niches, ecosystems. We wish to argue that the evo-
    lution of life marks the end of a physics world view of law
    entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon dis-
    cussing the variability of the very ”contexts of life”: the in-
    teractions between organisms, biological niches and ecosys-
    tems. These are ever changing, intrinsically indeterminate
    and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the
    ”niches” which constitute the boundary conditions on selec-
    tion. More generally, by the mathematical unprestatability
    of the ”phase space” (space of possibilities), no laws of mo-
    tion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical
    emergence, from life to life. The purpose of this paper is
    the integration of variation and diversity in a sound concep-
    tual frame and situate unpredictability at a novel theoretical
    level, that of the very phase space.
    Our argument will be carried on in close comparisons with
    physics and the mathematical constructions of phase spaces
    in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as
    invariant preserving transformations will allow us to under-
    stand the nature of physical phase spaces and to stress the
    differences required for a sound biological theoretizing. In
    this frame, we discuss the novel notion of ”enablement”. Life
    lives in a web of enablement and radical emergence. This
    will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a difference
    that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differ-
    ences will allow us to stress that ”non conservation princi-
    ples” are at the core of evolution, in contrast to physical
    dynamics, largely based on conservation principles as sym-
    metries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry
    changes in physics, will be discussed, and lead to ”extended
    criticality” as a conceptual frame for a better understanding
    of the living state of matter.},

Tout en prolongeant l'évolution des espèces, l'évolution de l'homme, jusqu'à son histoire, paraît aussi fournir, çà et là, des éléments de cette simplification qui choisit, transforme, organise l'action dans le monde, dont nous parlerons. On pourrait alors donner un sens historique à la notion de simplexité dans (Berthoz, 2009): 
    - c'est le simple qui résulte d'une histoire complexe, 
    - du simple qui n'est jamais élémentaire (atomique, irréductible).
    En physique, cette histoire peut être remplacée par une dynamique de modèles mathématiques qui aide à passer d'un système d'interactions locales, très complexe, à une situation globale, relativement plus simple, limite de la dynamique considérée. Ces dynamiques permettent de traiter les transitions critiques. Dans ce cas aussi, mais de façon fortement mathématisée, l'intégration globale de réseaux localement intelligibles, mais trop riches pour être saisis comme un tout, peut proposer une autre exemple de simplexité, plus technique, un exemple qui trouve son sens à la limite asymptotique. Les méthodes de renormalisation, auxquels nous ferons informellement référence, en donnent un aperçu de grande puissance physico-mathématique. Nous considérons le passage de l'analyse mathématique de la criticité physique à l'analyse du biologique, en tant que situation critique étendue, une transition conceptuelle possible de la théorisation physique à celle de l'état vivant de la matière.},

  abstract    = {Biological thinking is structured by the notion of level of organization. We will show that this notion acquires a precise meaning in critical phenomena: they disrupt, by the appearance of infinite quantities, the mathematical (possibly equational) determination at a given level, when moving at an ``higher'' one. As a result, their analysis cannot be called genuinely bottom-up, even though it remains upward in a restricted sense. At the same time, criticality and related phenomena are very common in biology. Because of this, we claim that bottom-up approaches are not sufficient, in principle, to capture biological phenomena. In the second part of this paper, following the work of Francis Bailly, we discuss a strong criterium of level transition. The core idea of the criterium is to start from the breaking of the symmetries and determination at a ``first'' level in order to ``move'' at the others. If biological phenomena have multiple, \emph{sustained} levels of organization in this sense, then they should be interpreted as \emph{extended} critical transitions.},

  abstract  = {We characterize access to empirical objects in biology from a theoretical perspective. Unlike objects in current physical theories, biological objects are the result of a history and their variations continue to generate a history. This property is the starting point of our concept of measurement. We argue that biological measurement is relative to a natural history which is shared by the different objects subjected to the measurement and is more or less constrained by biologists. We call symmetrization the theoretical and often concrete operation which leads to considering biological objects as equivalent in a measurement. Last, we use our notion of measurement to analyze research strategies. Some strategies aim to bring biology closer to the epistemology of physical theories, by studying objects as similar as possible, while others build on biological diversity.},

The quantitative unsupervised analysis used 91 measurements and produced the most striking nonmonotonic dose–response curves. At all time points, lower doses resulted in larger effects, consistent with the core study, which revealed a significant increase of mammary adenocarcinoma incidence in the stop-dose animals at the lowest BPA dose tested.},

We explicitly borrow from the conclusions in some key chapters and introduce them by a reflection on "incompleteness", also proposed in the book. We consider that incompleteness is a fundamental notion to understand the way in which we construct knowledge. Then we will introduce an approach to biological dynamics where randomness is central to the theoretical determination: randomness does not oppose biological stability but contributes to it by variability, adaptation, and diversity. Then, evolutionary and ontogenetic trajectories are continual changes of coherence structures involving symmetry changes within an ever-changing global stability.},

In the latter case, the peculiarities of agent-based or object oriented languages allow to discuss the role of phase spaces in mathematical analyses of physical versus biological dynamics.

The idea is to work towards a Theory of Organisms analogue and along the Theory of Evolution, where ontogenesis could be considered as part of phylogenesis. As a matter of fact, the latter is made out of "segments" of the first: phylogenesis is the "sum" of ontogenetic paths and they should be made intelligible by similar principles. To this aim, we look at ontogenesis from different perspectives. By this, we shed light on the unity of the organism from different points of view, yet constantly keeping that unity as a core invariant. The analysis of invariance, as the result of theoretical symmetries, and of symmetry changes, is a key theme of the approach in the book and in the discussion in this note.},

Ce modèle permet de mettre en évidence la structure de la variabilité des rythmes biologiques et de discriminer cas sains et cas pathologiques. Nous utilisons cet exemple pour illustrer les principes permettant la mathématisation. Nous discutons comment s'articulent mathématiques et définition théorique des objets physiques. Nous mettons en particulier l'accent sur le rôle que jouent les symétries théoriques pour justifier ces définitions, tant au niveau de la constitution d'un espace de description que de l'obtention d'équations déterminant la trajectoire suivie par un objet. Nous abordons aussi les transitions de phases comme situations paradigmatiques où les symétries d'un système changent. Ceci nous amène à proposer que les objets biologiques (organismes, cellules) sont caractérisés par une instabilité de leurs symétries théoriques. Les objets prennent alors un sens différent de celui qu'ils ont en physique : ils font preuve de variabilité et sont fondamentalement historiques. Ceci n'empêche pas la présence d’éléments de stabilité chez le vivant, mais les symétries biologiques prennent un sens différent des symétries fondamentales de la physique.},

  abstract  = {This paper analyzes, in terms of critical transitions, the phase spaces of biological dynamics. The phase space is the space where the scientific description and determination of a phenomenon is given. We argue that one major aspect of biological evolution is the continual change of the pertinent phase space and the unpredictability of these changes. This analysis will be based on the theoretical symmetries in biology and on their critical instability along evolution. Our hypothesis deeply modifies the tools and concepts used in physical theorizing, when adapted to biology. In particular, we argue that causality has to be understood differently, and we discuss two notions to do so: differential causality and enablement. In this context constraints play a key role: on one side, they restrict possibilities, on the other, they enable biological systems to integrate changing constraints in their organization, by correlated variations, in un-prestatable ways. This corresponds to the formation of new 
    phenotypes and organisms.},
